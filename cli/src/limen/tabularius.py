"""TABVLARIVS — the one record-keeper over the board (`tasks.yaml`).

The disease this dissolves: ~32 uncoordinated writers each do *read-whole-board → mutate →
rewrite-whole-board* on the single `tasks.yaml` blob. `io.atomic_write_text` already stops torn
*bytes* (temp-file + `os.replace`), but two writers that both `load→save` still lost-update-clobber
(last-writer-wins on the whole board), and the worst offenders (the MCP server) skip even the
atomic write. Locking every `save` would give write-*atomicity* but not read-modify-write
*isolation* — the clobber survives. The only correct cure is the **single-writer principle**:
workers stop mutating shared state and instead APPEND one immutable *ticket* per unit of work to a
lock-free inbox; exactly **one** keeper drains the inbox, folds the tickets onto the board in
timestamp order, validates (per-task + the collapse-guard), and seals the result with the atomic
write. It is the only process that ever holds the write lock, so there is no interleave to tear.

This is Step 2+3 of `board-is-event-log-projection` (PR#543): `materialize.fold` is the proven pure
reducer — this module gives it a live stream to consume. A ticket **is** a `materialize` Event with
provenance (who did the work, when), and the archived ticket files are the append-only event log
that the board is a projection of (`board = fold(events)`).

Ticket lifecycle::

    logs/tickets/inbox/<id>.json  --drain-->  applied → archive/   (the event log)
                                              rejected → rejected/  (+ <id>.reason.txt)

Design invariants (each carried over from a shipped safety precedent):
  * **A worker never touches `tasks.yaml`.** It calls `submit_ticket`, an exclusive atomic create
    into the inbox — no read, no lock, no collapse risk, no interleave. (Preserves the one writer
    the fleet must never starve, `ingest-backlog.py`, which deliberately skipped the lock.)
  * **One bad ticket never rejects the batch.** Each ticket is applied + validated individually;
    a bad one is quarantined to `rejected/` and the rest still land (the `_sanitize_dispatch_logs`
    tolerate-and-salvage philosophy from `io.py`).
  * **The seal is collapse-guarded.** The board is written through `save_limen_file`, so the
    2026-06-26 shrink-to-1 clobber remains impossible; a batch that would collapse the board is
    rejected whole and the good board is left intact.
  * **Never dead-stop the beat.** If the queue lock is held (a legacy writer, mid-migration), the
    keeper defers to the next beat rather than blocking — exactly like `heal-board.py`.
