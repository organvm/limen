"""Live readiness checks for explicit task execution requirements.

Completion predicates answer whether work is done.  Execution requirements answer whether the
current control host can start that work at all.  Keeping those contracts separate lets handoff
and every dispatcher use the same live, read-only gate without interpreting task titles, labels,
ids, or prose.

Legacy tasks have no ``execution_requirements`` field and remain ready by default.  Once a task
declares requirements, malformed or unsupported entries fail closed so a typo cannot spend a run
under conditions the owner did not authorize.
