# Laptop-Wide Recovery and Closeout Continuation

## Objective

Reach the fixed point defined by the 2026-07-23 recovery plan: restore Claude through the Domus cartridge only after its remote activation gates pass; preserve all unowned work before touching shared roots; reclaim enough receipt-gated storage for `/System/Volumes/Data` to report below 80%; restore authenticated broker/governor dispatch; and land at least one valuable bounded Jules receipt. Do not substitute motion or partial scans for these predicates.

## Live evidence at capsule creation

- Domus clean deployment worktree: `/Users/4jp/Workspace/domus-genoma/.worktrees/limen-admission-host-deploy-20260723`, clean detached `4fc34ddceb1eb0285c0565eef984ce3c8738b0a2`, exactly live `origin/master`.
- Domus issue `#318` is the Claude activation owner. Limen `#1326` and `#1330` are merged; `#1325` is OPEN/CONFLICTING at `128dca2428e6ece264b4de72b860d8f72a88f4b7`. Its last Python CI failure is only `ruff format --check cli/tests/test_host_admission.py`; `pr-gate` passed.
- Installed `~/.claude/settings.json` is valid but references 19 missing Domus-managed absolute command targets, including all three `UserPromptSubmit` handlers. Do not apply until `#1325` merges.
- Victoroff root `/Users/4jp/Workspace/victoroff-os` has unpushed commit `c93fdc56e4647c31a7e172d01e6a4d8904d995f3` plus five unstaged files (1,237 insertions / 133 deletions). No remote ref contains the commit. Draft PR `organvm/victoroff-os#26` owns a separate lane and is green.
- CCE successor commit `6701377` is clean but lacks upstream, PR, and a workstream capsule. Hospes child is dead; its clean pushed state is owned by draft PR `organvm/hospes#13`.
- `/System/Volumes/Data` reports 94% used. The safe target is at least 62.01 GiB reclaimed. No fresh deletion-authorized tranche exists: the read-only classifier blocks the fresh Python inventories, and `docs/antigravity-scratch-reap-acceptance.jsonl` is absent.
- Host admission denies new heavy starts on Backblaze RSS, swap, and disk throughput. Preserve live peers; remote/read-only work may continue.
- Immutable Limen runtime already includes `rfc8785`. Broker credentials are not hydrated into the current process. The credential-owner atom is recorded on Limen issue `#320`; never print values.
- Governor is `observe`, dispatch disabled, maintenance window expired, no pause marker, and the shared Limen root is dirty/ahead/behind. Jules remains healthy at 0/100.
- Durable receipts created by the prior session: Domus issue `#318` comments, Limen PR `#1325` comments, Limen credential wall `#320`, and this branch.

## Authorities and prohibitions

- TABVLARIVS owns task state; never edit `tasks.yaml`.
- Domus owns global Claude/host configuration. Never patch `~/.claude` directly, disable a hook, weaken policy, or apply from the dirty primary Domus checkout.
- Preserve every live owner. Do not signal, adopt, retune, stash, reset, or reap a peer process/worktree.
- Do not launch a new local-heavy surface while live admission denies it. Jules is remote and does not consume local capacity.
- Do not delete personal/raw/session data without manifests, hashes, counts, two independent readable custody copies, and sampled restore proof.
- Do not merge PRs, deploy, send outbound communication, expose credentials, or create paid spend.
- Work only from isolated linked worktrees with scoped writer leases. The installed read-only classifier false positive must be repaired in its owner lane, never bypassed.

## First probes

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and this contract in full.
2. Query live remote state for Limen `#1325`, Domus `#318`, Victoroff `#22-#26`, and Hospes `#13` before trusting local clones.
3. Snapshot host admission and every live Codex/Claude/OpenCode/Agy/Copilot/Limen owner without broad protected macOS probes.
4. Re-run `df -k /System/Volumes/Data`; do not use remembered byte counts.
5. Fix `#1325` in its existing isolated worktree: reconcile current `main` once, format the implicated test, run only host-admission/Codex-hook scoped predicates, push exact head, and use the merge queue.
6. Before touching Victoroff, obtain sanctioned all-process cwd proof. Preserve `c93fdc5` plus the binary working delta on an isolated remote branch and draft PR; compare it to PRs `#22-#26` and supersede duplicates.

## Execution order

1. Close and merge-queue the existing `#1325` owner receipt without repeated base rewrites.
2. After `#1325` merges, acquire the clean Domus worktree writer scope; run a source-explicit `chezmoi -S` diff/apply of settings plus the complete dependency closure parsed from rendered settings. Reject any missing/non-executable/unowned target. Verify the existing Claude session, then wait for local-heavy admission before three fresh cycles. Record hashes, timing, duplicate convergence, and rollback on `#318`.
3. Land Domus recurrence prevention: activation docs plus a regression predicate deriving all managed command targets from rendered settings.
4. Preserve Victoroff and CCE remotely before any local reclamation. Keep Hospes on PR `#13` unless live evidence changes.
5. Repair the read-only action classifier with focused regression tests, then refresh `worktree-debt.py --json`, `antigravity-scratch-bridge.py --json`, removal acceptance, live cwd protection, remote reachability, and PR state.
6. Archive bulky session/corpus owners with two-copy restore proof. Reap only accepted clean/inactive/exact-head-preserved roots in finite root-only tranches with generated cleanup disabled. Handle generated caches separately. Repeat until disk is below 80% and a second accepted pass removes zero roots.
7. Refresh/rotate the conduct credential through issue `#320`, hydrate without tracing, prove `limen conduct capabilities`, reconcile the board only through the keeper, prove live-root/heartbeat/admission/governor gates, and transition through the autonomy-governor owner interface.
8. Dispatch one valuable bounded Jules packet, verify its remote receipt, then refill only with independently owned finite packets while capacity remains healthy.

## Completion predicates

- Claude existing-session prompt succeeds; later three admitted fresh start/end cycles pass; `#318` records installed hashes, timing, convergence, rollback, and recurrence-prevention PR.
- Every session/intent has exactly one live owner, terminal receipt, successor capsule, supersession record, or exact blocker.
- Victoroff `c93fdc5` and its working delta have a remote draft-PR receipt before the shared root changes.
- `df` reports below 80%; accepted reaper second pass removes zero; every survivor is reason-coded; custody proofs cover every archived personal/raw store.
- `limen conduct capabilities` succeeds; governor dispatch is live; at least one bounded Jules receipt lands and the meter advances from 0/100.
- Scoped predicates pass on immutable exact heads; no live peer or personal data was harmed.

## Session switch conditions

Stop before the eight-hour deadline, on any credential/paid/public/destructive gate, when host admission denies a required new heavy start, or if owner truth conflicts. File the exact gate once on its existing owner and emit a successor capsule before expiry. Never wait out a future gate while independent remote/read-only work exists.

## Launch

```bash
git -C /Users/4jp/Workspace/limen fetch origin work/laptop-wide-recovery-closeout-20260723 && limen workstream /Users/4jp/Workspace/limen laptop-wide-recovery-closeout-20260723 --from origin/work/laptop-wide-recovery-closeout-20260723 --workstream recovery-closeout --runway 8h --agent auto --autonomous --conduct --prompt 'Read and execute docs/continuations/laptop-wide-recovery-closeout-20260723/README.md and workstream.json. Re-derive all live state before mutation; preserve owners; stop before contract expiry.'
