# Current Session Fanout

Generated: `2026-06-30T13:05:59+00:00`
Packet: `PLAN-08-a2c2ca1e`
Focus theme: `current-session-intake`
Status: `ready`

## Canonical Decision

- PLAN-08 is the current-session-intake planner: it routes the whole source session into owner packets before executor fanout.
- Packet derivation reads all parsed turns, not only the latest turn.
- Public output contains prompt/plan hashes, counts, criteria, predicates, and receipt targets only.
- Blocked local work is recorded as a local packet; it is not a global product-selection stop.

## Executor Criteria

### `OWNER-current-session-intake-a2c2ca1e`

- Route: Regenerate the redacted current-session fanout receipt from the full JSONL, then keep downstream work bounded by owner packet, predicate, and receipt.
- Criteria:
  - Read every JSONL line and every turn_context before deriving packets.
  - Hash prompt and plan bodies; do not write raw prompt text to public files.
  - Emit owner packets with source turn spans, executor criteria, predicates, and stop gates.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/current-session-fanout.py --session <session.jsonl> --theme current-session-intake --write`
  - `python3 -m pytest cli/tests/test_current_session_fanout.py -q`

### `OWNER-alpha-omega-product-ledger-ff680cea`

- Route: Select product surfaces from measured repo/value evidence, not from the latest prompt alone.
- Criteria:
  - Candidate must name an owner repo or tracked owner ledger.
  - Candidate must expose one buyer/user-facing predicate before broad build-out.
  - Candidate must be reversible until a human opens deployment, spend, or outbound gates.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/generate-positioning.py --frontdoor --discoverability`
  - `python3 scripts/generate-revenue-backlog.py --floor 3 --max-new 0`

### `OWNER-money-inbound-seo-37b731f8`

- Route: Convert revenue intent into discoverability and first-dollar predicates for unblocked repos.
- Criteria:
  - Name the exact product/repo and the buyer/user query being served.
  - Prefer dry-run positioning and backlog generation before queue mutation.
  - Do not send email, publish pricing, or spend money without a human gate.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/generate-positioning.py --discoverability`
  - `python3 scripts/generate-revenue-backlog.py --floor 3 --max-new 0`

### `OWNER-repo-salvage-consolidation-1c17c8a3`

- Route: Route repo sprawl into owner surfaces and receipts before executor fanout.
- Criteria:
  - Owner repo or workspace root must be explicit.
  - No deletion, transfer, force-push, or mass merge without a human gate.
  - Packet must say whether the output is product, preservation, or non-source residue.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/session-attack-paths.py --write`
  - `python3 scripts/conductor-tranche.py --write`

### `OWNER-contrib-mirror-0bd58d68`

  - Separate private prompt/context evidence from public contribution text.
  - Require a local predicate or PR receipt before claiming completion.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/session-attack-paths.py --write`
  - `python3 scripts/conductor-tranche.py --write`

### `OWNER-full-fleet-overnight-ea38d4d8`

- Route: Keep dispatch work behind live lane health, usage ceilings, and bounded predicates.
- Criteria:
  - Lane must be reachable and not marked exhausted, rate-limited, or low.
  - Packet must include repo, branch/worktree, predicate, and expected receipt.
  - Local/free floor is fallback, not a reason for speculative fanout.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/usage-telemetry.py --write`
  - `python3 scripts/dispatch-health.py --write`
  - `python3 scripts/conductor-tranche.py --write`

### `OWNER-dynamic-substrate-f0b8bc86`

- Route: Derive roots and capability availability at use-time; record missing roots as substrate facts.
- Criteria:
  - Do not pin a stale drive/path/version when an env/config probe can derive it.
  - Record unavailable local roots as blockers, not global product stops.
  - Never copy secrets or private prompt bodies into public receipts.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/capability-substrate-ledger.py --write`
  - `python3 scripts/session-blockers-ledger.py --write`

### `BLOCKED-quota-reset-guard-cef1699a`

- Route: Record reset/credit constraints as local spend guards; continue unblocked product selection.
- Criteria:
  - Do not consume resets, credits, top-ups, or paid overages from this packet.
  - Use live usage telemetry before expanding lane fanout.
  - Surface the cheapest human action once, then route other work around it.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/usage-telemetry.py --write`
  - `python3 scripts/session-blockers-ledger.py --write`
- Local blocker: recorded here; does not block `global-product-selection`.

### `BLOCKED-domus-preflight-noise-5aa10d25`

- Route: Keep local Domus/preflight noise as a separate blocked-local packet.
- Criteria:
  - Stay in the Domus owner checkout named by the packet.
  - Do not turn shell noise into global product or revenue blocking.
  - Return a local predicate and blocker receipt if the environment is not repairable in-scope.
- Verification predicates:
  - `domus-packages review --json`
  - `storage-lifecycle-audit --quick`
- Local blocker: recorded here; does not block `global-product-selection`.

### `OWNER-private-sauce-boundary-b131e64c`

- Route: Route private context through hashes and owner ledgers before public artifacts.
- Criteria:
  - Public files may contain hashes, paths, counts, criteria, and receipts only.
  - Raw private prompt or plan bodies stay out of commits, PRs, task logs, and outbound systems.
  - If public copy is needed, write a redacted derivation and keep the source hash lineage.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/censor.py --help`
  - `git diff --check`

### `OWNER-peer-planner-worktrees-f3f5e6a4`

- Route: Keep planner worktrees as planning lanes until executor packets meet owner/predicate gates.
- Criteria:
  - Planner packet must have a unique worktree/branch and no dirty inherited state.
  - Executor handoff requires owner repo, criteria, predicate, and receipt target.
  - Do not broad-dispatch from a planner packet that only names a theme.
- Verification predicates:
  - `git status --short --branch`
  - `python3 scripts/current-session-fanout.py --session <session.jsonl> --theme current-session-intake`

### `OWNER-autopoietic-orchestration-5bdbeb44`

- Route: Keep the system breathing through bounded local work, not unbounded spend or broad fanout.
- Criteria:
  - Expand only after cheap local checks identify a real executor packet.
  - Stop outward/irreversible work at the human gate.
  - Record blockers and select the next unblocked owner/product packet.
- Verification predicates:
  - `python3 scripts/autonomy-governor.py explain`
  - `python3 scripts/session-value-review.py --gate --hours 1.5`

## Blocked Local Work

| Packet | Owner | Gate | Does Not Block | Predicate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BLOCKED-quota-reset-guard-cef1699a` | usage and reset governance | `blocked-local-recorded` | `global-product-selection` | `python3 scripts/usage-telemetry.py --write` |
| `BLOCKED-domus-preflight-noise-5aa10d25` | domus local preflight | `blocked-local-recorded` | `global-product-selection` | `domus-packages review --json` |

## Product Selection Continuity

- Status: `active`.
- Reason: blocked local work is recorded separately and does not stop product selection.
- Candidate themes: `alpha-omega-product-ledger`, `money-inbound-seo`, `repo-salvage-consolidation`, `contrib-mirror`.
- Predicates: `python3 scripts/conductor-tranche.py --write`, `python3 scripts/generate-positioning.py --discoverability`, `python3 scripts/generate-positioning.py --frontdoor --discoverability`, `python3 scripts/generate-revenue-backlog.py --floor 3 --max-new 0`, `python3 scripts/session-attack-paths.py --write`.

## Private Output

- Private redacted index: `.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/current-session-fanout.json`.
- The private index stores hash lineage and packet membership only; it does not store raw prompt text.

## Commands

- Refresh this receipt: `python3 scripts/current-session-fanout.py --session <session.jsonl> --theme current-session-intake --write`
- Test this planner: `python3 -m pytest cli/tests/test_current_session_fanout.py -q`
- Whole gate: `bash scripts/verify-whole.sh`
