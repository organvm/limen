## Full-Fleet Overnight Owner Packet

Packet: `PLAN-02-ea38d4d8`
Owner repo: `organvm/limen`
Owner ledger: `docs/current-session-fanout.md`

Executor criteria:

- derive lane inventory from PAID_AGENT_ORDER, not hand-written local lists
- `auto` selects active reachable lanes while down/depleted/human-gated lanes stay visible in receipts
- `all` preserves every registered lane for audit without pretending down lanes are runnable
- async dry-runs do not launch live dispatch or spend resets/credits
- blocked local gates are recorded as local blockers while global product selection remains active

Verification predicates:

- `LIMEN_ROOT=$PWD LIMEN_TASKS=$PWD/tasks.yaml python3 scripts/current-session-fanout.py --session <session.jsonl> --min-planners 10 --executor-lanes auto --include-contrib --no-reset-spend --dry-run`
- `PYTHONPATH=cli/src python3 -m pytest cli/tests/test_current_session_fanout.py -q`
- `PYTHONPATH=cli/src python3 -c "from limen.capacity import PAID_AGENT_ORDER; required={'codex','claude','opencode','agy','gemini','ollama','jules','copilot','warp','oz','github_actions'}; assert required <= set(PAID_AGENT_ORDER)"`
- `LIMEN_ROOT=$PWD LIMEN_TASKS=$PWD/tasks.yaml PYTHONPATH=cli/src python3 scripts/dispatch-async.py --lanes auto --dry-run`
- `bash scripts/verify-whole.sh`

## Lane Classification

## Blocked Local Work

Global product selection remains `active`.

## Contract

- Planning and execution are peer roles, not provider rank: select a co-equal keeper from live
  capability, availability, spend, and acceptance evidence.
- Down, depleted, or human-gated lanes are receipts, not a global stop condition.
- This command never applies Codex resets, credits, top-ups, or paid overages.
- Outbound identity-bearing actions remain human-gated.
