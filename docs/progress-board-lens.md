# Limen Board Progress and Source-Coverage Lens

`limen progress` is a partial terminal lens over two bounded surfaces:

1. normalized task-board rows from `tasks.yaml`; and
2. readiness contracts for named local source receipts.

It does not ingest the source-owned leaves behind prompt, GitHub-estate, lifecycle, mail, financial,
or contribution receipts. It must not be cited as proof that the whole work estate has been
enumerated. The JSON payload says `scope: partial` and retains the older
`limen.progress-universe.v1` schema identifier only so existing consumers remain compatible.

## Terminal use

```bash
# Board summary, source readiness, and the highest-priority 50 active board leaves
limen progress

# Select one board grouping and optional exact scope
limen progress --view origin
limen progress --view horizon --scope past
limen progress --view workstream --scope financial
limen progress --view source_lineage --scope prompt-lineage-7

# Print every matching active board leaf or return the bounded JSON projection
limen progress --all
limen progress --json-output
limen progress --report-file logs/board-progress-source-coverage.json
```

Macro bars show board statuses and metadata coverage. Micro bars show canonical lifecycle stage;
they are deliberately not percent-of-effort estimates. `--view`, `--scope`, and `--level` are
non-interactive filters, not a TUI. Terminal rows remain in JSON and macro counts but are omitted from
the active micro-debt list.

## Debt units

The lens keeps three non-interchangeable counts separate:

- `board_debt`: task-board rows not in `done` or `archived`;
- `coverage_debt`: required source contracts that are missing, stale, undated, unavailable, failed,
  capped, partial, or incomplete; and
- `verified_receipt_debt`: terminal board claims without explicit verified-receipt evidence.

Source readiness is stricter than timestamp freshness. When a source publishes semantic fields such
as `status`, `verdict`, `available`, `complete`, `exhaustive`, `capped`, or `truncated`, negative or
partial values remain coverage debt even when the timestamp is fresh. This command does not inspect
or guess the underlying source leaves.

## Board metadata and work-loan signals

Board producers can provide the following explicit fields or labels:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `origin` / `origin:*` | `obligation`, `human_prompt`, `agent_recommendation`, or `system_debt` |
| `horizon` / `horizon:*` | `past`, `present`, or `future` |
| `workstream` | Purpose lane, distinct from the execution provider |
| `source_lineage` / `lineage:*` | Explicit source-owned cohort; absence remains `unknown` |
| `due_at` / `due:*` | Exact deadline when one exists |
| `repo` and `urls` | Durable owner surface and evidence |
| `predicate` | Executable definition of done |
| `receipt_target` | Durable terminal custody target |
| `value_case` | Forecast reason for spending capacity |
| `receipt_verified: true` | Explicit owner-produced verification evidence; never inferred by this lens |

The `WORK LOANS` bar reports metadata underwriting, not funding or approval. It requires an explicit
origin, horizon, value case, owner repo, run cost, predicate, and receipt target. Requested
`budget_cost` is exposed as `debit_requested_runs`; it is not actual token, money, time, host, or
provider spend. `credit_forecast` is text, not earned value. A terminal status with contract strings
is a board credit claim; only explicit receipt-verification evidence reduces
`verified_receipt_debt`.

The owner QA endpoint may set `receipt_verified: true` only on a `done` transition carrying a zero
predicate exit code, the task's exact declared receipt target, a positive receipt-verification
attestation, and a 64-hex verification-context digest. Merely changing lifecycle status to `done`
does not create verified progress credit.

The same `WorkLoanV1` readiness predicate is enforced by the keeper before packet reservation or
claim and by task projection before a new row or active transition is accepted. Missing fields use
the stable denial `task-not-underwritten:<comma-separated-fields>`. Historical rows remain visible
but cannot consume capacity until their source-owned cohort supplies the missing collateral; intake
must not invent a value case from title prose. In `logs/handoff.json`, `ostensible_next` remains the
raw priority candidate while `dispatchable_next` (and the compatibility alias `next_action`) means
the candidate cleared underwriting, dependency, budget, provider-health, human-gate, and execution
requirements. `dispatch_admission.reason_counts` explains every gated open row.

Raw discoveries remain in their source-owned feed or staging ledger until a producer can pass the
ask gate and WorkLoan predicate. The board writer rejects a new ununderwritten row; it does not
silently turn the discovery into work. For legacy repair, `--view source_lineage` and each group's
`underwriting_denial_counts` expose cohort-sized gaps. An absent lineage is `unknown` and must not be
treated as zero debt or filled by guessing from a title. Duplicate or superseded lifecycle changes
still require explicit source-lineage evidence and a broker transition.

## Content-addressed inputs

Each JSON snapshot includes:

- a SHA-256 of the normalized task board;
- both raw-byte and canonical parsed-JSON SHA-256 values for each readable source receipt; and
- one contract hash over the normalized board, canonical source hashes (or raw bytes for invalid
  input), read states, the surface schema, and `scope: partial`.

The generation timestamp is intentionally outside the content hash because freshness changes with
evaluation time. JSON whitespace and object-key order do not change the contract hash. Equal input
hashes prove equal semantic input content, not equal freshness verdicts.

## Work intentionally left to owner packets

Dynamic source discovery, exhaustive GitHub-estate enumeration, prompt-atom lineage, actual
debit/credit reconciliation, interactive terminal zoom, and historical priority selection are
separate products. Their absence remains visible coverage debt; this lens does not simulate them.
