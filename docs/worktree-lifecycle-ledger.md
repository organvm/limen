# Canonical Worktree Lifecycle Ledger

Last audited: 2026-07-06 from `/Users/4jp/Workspace/limen`.

This is the canonical working ledger for roots under
`/Users/4jp/Workspace/.limen-worktrees`. A root exits this ledger only through a
visible lifecycle receipt:

- merged or patch-equivalent on the remote default branch;
- open PR or pushed preserve branch;
- explicit blocker/task record naming the retained work;
- documented non-source residue classification.

Five duplicate local checkout directories were removed during the follow-up pass
only after their local `HEAD` matched the fetched remote PR head exactly:
`bld-domus-genoma-ci-23a9`, `bld-media-ark-tests-2698`,
`bld-universal-mail--automation-readme-9031`,
`bld2-a-i-chat--exporter-integration-tests-a00b`, and `exporter-mp`.
The unique work remains preserved on the remote branches and open draft PRs.

## Current Scan

2026-07-06 organvm-engine #136 dirty-owner blocker pass:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json` reported 102 scanned roots with 1 debt-bearing root:
  `heal-cifix-organvm-organvm-engine-136-c3d543d8`, classified as `dirty`.
- Read-only owner-worktree inspection showed the root is on branch `limen/jules-limen-067-1688`
  at local `HEAD` `48a61947641c392246ebb74a15945340fbc4a7af`, with dirty tracked changes in
  `src/organvm_engine/cli/__init__.py`, `src/organvm_engine/cli/context.py`, and
  `src/organvm_engine/contextmd/sync.py`.
- Live remote/PR proof showed GitHub PR
  [#136](https://github.com/organvm/organvm-engine/pull/136) and remote branch
  `limen/jules-limen-067-1688` preserve `e137b6c3df27ec940f176f649f5bf5468166adde`, not the
  local `HEAD` `48a61947641c392246ebb74a15945340fbc4a7af`.
- Preserved the local-only commit patch and the dirty worktree patch under
  `.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/worktree-preserve/2026-07-06T135343Z-heal-cifix-organvm-organvm-engine-136-c3d543d8/`.
  Public SHA-256 evidence is recorded in `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json`.
- Classified the root as `owner-blocker` / `private_patch_preserved`. No local reclaim, deletion,
  force-push, merge, owner-repo source edit, or task-board mutation was performed.
- During the same pass, `heal-cifix-organvm-organvm-engine-139-11d32b27` aged out of the active
  grace window and appeared as `unpushed-commits` because the local checkout had not fetched the
  remote PR ref. Live proof showed GitHub PR
  [#139](https://github.com/organvm/organvm-engine/pull/139) is `OPEN`, non-draft, and its
  `headRefOid` `81f218a1a83bc6fc623ee6242e824c8018fa2508` equals local `HEAD`; `git ls-remote`
  also shows `refs/heads/limen/resolve-a-organvm-organvm-engine-112-c362` at the same commit.
  Added a `remote-pr-open` receipt only. No local reclaim, deletion, force-push, merge,
  owner-repo source edit, or task-board mutation was performed.

2026-07-06 org-health first-slice residue pass:

- Selected conductor packet `tranche-org-health-organ-firstslice-0704-aac2b482`.
- Read-only inspection of
  `/Users/4jp/Workspace/.limen-worktrees/org-health-organ-firstslice-0704-aac2b482`
  found no `.git` metadata and no owner source files. The root contains only
  `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json` (1,237 bytes, SHA-256
  `4cad9d67c495f4bdd076b7fb985ab26b3f2d179ca998cd3577a216a3f134b399`) and
  `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` (193 bytes, SHA-256
  `f7796610ac423010cd88a9a9e516eebf1ccfac4ffa09337a9e04502cfb1a0c3e`).
- Added a `documented-residue` receipt for `org-health-organ-firstslice-0704-aac2b482` in
  `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json`. This records a non-source residue proof only:
  no local reclaim, deletion, force-push, merge, task-board mutation, or owner-repo source edit
  was performed.
- Continued under the regenerated `tranche-worktree-lifecycle-debt` packet and classified the
  remaining visible debt roots by receipt only. Live GitHub PR inspection showed
  `heal-cifix-organvm-organvm-engine-124-e0bb2d06` is preserved by merged PR
  [#124](https://github.com/organvm/organvm-engine/pull/124), whose `headRefOid`
  `1209c8b5e5c6539876d0188f5b1cd75a78884c2d` equals local `HEAD`; `pr-669-governance-deepen` is
  preserved by merged PR [#669](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/669), whose `headRefOid`
  `3dc75166a4a254a025c0f2e8f77b10d5956a3a3a` equals local `HEAD`; and
  `heal-cifix-organvm-organvm-engine-130-8a6060e4` is preserved by open PR
  [#130](https://github.com/organvm/organvm-engine/pull/130), whose `headRefOid`
  `520a81385ac3049e8eb62e10d560dce04fe61c29` equals local `HEAD` but remains `DIRTY`.
- Also classified `org-health-organ-firstslice-0704-caa4e142` as documented non-source residue
  after read-only inspection found only `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json` (1,205 bytes,
  SHA-256 `58efbe4718acd7127093a7cb079e3d41a9aa868fe55f40f3db33ba4454ede8f7`) and
  `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md` (193 bytes, SHA-256
  `d98e3edd238e252444d7f08b78508f4951d45bb78bbb9ea6d0e4e8bde4a61b0b`).
- No local reclaim, deletion, force-push, merge, owner-repo source edit, or task-board mutation was
  performed while closing these lifecycle debt receipts.
- Later in the same gate-open pass, `heal-cifix-organvm-organvm-engine-130-ec1fdfaf` aged out of
  the active window and was classified as a duplicate local checkout for the same open PR
  [#130](https://github.com/organvm/organvm-engine/pull/130). Live PR inspection at
  `2026-07-06T12:46:10Z` showed the PR remains `OPEN`, non-draft, merge state `DIRTY`, and
  `headRefOid` `520a81385ac3049e8eb62e10d560dce04fe61c29` equals local `HEAD`. No local reclaim,
  deletion, force-push, merge, owner-repo source edit, or task-board mutation was performed.

2026-07-06 remote-supersession pass:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json` initially reported 48 roots with 1 debt-bearing
  root: `linear-conjuring-bear`, classified as `not-merged-to-default`.
- Read-only inspection found branch `session/post-moneta-durability` at
  `01c7773cd42adf2e9a3c4277bb635bc1a53eaf3f`, preserved by draft PR
  [#635](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/635), but the PR is `CONFLICTING` and not
  merge-ready.
- The branch is superseded by current `origin/main`: commit `21ba3f3b` already staged the
  consolidation execution packet under `docs/consolidation/EXECUTION-MANIFEST.md` and
  `scripts/consolidation-*-apply.sh`; current main's scripts retain the explicit
  `LIMEN_CONSOLIDATION_GATE=consolidation-gate-open` hard gate, while the draft branch's copies
  remove that guard. Main also carries the richer `docs/session-2026-07-03-audit-trail.md`.
- Added a `remote-superseded` receipt for `linear-conjuring-bear` in
  `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json`. No PR was merged or closed, no branch was deleted,
  no local checkout was removed, and no GitHub consolidation command was run.
- Re-run proof after the receipt: `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --fail-over-cap` reports
  0 debt roots / 49 scanned roots, with `linear-conjuring-bear` classified as
  `remote-superseded`.
- Also classified active root `fluttering-twirling-abelson` as default-branch-preserved:
  local `HEAD` `034ab5f61f364f4acd99266a10fc00de856698da` is an ancestor of current
  `origin/main` `b80e782aa0c93f5d5cca4c57bed82bc8d390e993`, and
  `git diff origin/main...HEAD` is empty. No PR was opened, no branch was pushed, and no local
  checkout was removed.

2026-07-04 lifecycle closeout pass:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json`: 77 roots, 0 debt-bearing roots, cap 12.
- Current class mix: 34 documented residue roots, 15 open-PR remote-preserved roots,
  8 remote-merged/default-preserved roots, 8 owner-blocker roots, and 12 active roots under grace
  windows.
- Classified 34 `not-a-git-dir` roots as documented non-source residue after read-only inspection.
  Every classified path contains exactly two files, `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.json` and
  `logs/session-lifecycle-pressure.md`, and no Git metadata or source files. Exact byte counts and
  SHA-256 hashes are recorded in `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json`.
- Classified `feat+workstream-channels` as remote-preserved by draft PR
  [#634](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/634). Local `HEAD`
  `dc0498d192c2aa76bf98d1b7fa0dda496baf3c8b` equals `origin/heal/revive-self-heal-beat`
  and the PR `headRefOid`; the scanner now reports this root as `remote-pr-open`.
- Classified `agent-aefc63d95daa3131b` as an owner blocker, not reclaimable lifecycle residue.
  Local `HEAD` `d45b030d1427826c1c0c54b3cb54d552b94104a0` equals
  `origin/work/photos-universe-20260629-182431`; PR
  [#497](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/497) is closed unmerged. The private proof receipt
  is recorded under
  `.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/worktree-preserve/2026-07-04T184224Z-agent-aefc63d95daa3131b/receipt.json`.
- Classified `gh-organvm-domus-genoma-170-bbbc` as default-branch-preserved. Local `HEAD`
  `24a251c550c438f90d8e495fdb2b5e62b34a0d22` is an ancestor of `origin/master`
  `97b3f2c6169b83a20e0d1a61ef95b6621d0e1533`; the only dirty item is untracked
  `logs/agents/opencode.json` (293 bytes, SHA-256
  `d476defb235606087f3a33c53eba2fb039086e0c3f91318b335cc7e658a460ff`).
- Classified the final four debt roots:
  `GEN-organvm-limen-ci-green-0702` is preserved by merged PR
  [#574](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/574), whose `headRefOid`
  `ced1164444df42fe8fd4b48924bd4f3f420291e7` equals local `HEAD`;
  `peer-audited--behavioral-blockchain`, `review-avditor-billing-pr43`, and
  `wf_29a15be5-9f8-2` have exact private patch receipts under
  `.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/worktree-preserve/` and are now owner blockers rather
  than reclaimable lifecycle residue.
- Closed the stale prompt-index reference `docs-file-fleet-dispatch-lever`: the recorded head
  `1f71ebeffefda1a9f35e3869d9804564f125cf23` is an ancestor of current `origin/main`, and the local
  path no longer exists.
- Closed the stale prompt-index reference `org-social-organ-firstslice-0703-e618`: the recorded
  head `954f36294540` is an ancestor of current `origin/main`, and the local path no longer exists.
- Closed the stale prompt-index reference `org-hr-organ-charter-0704-2089`: the recorded head
  `1f71ebeffefda1a9f35e3869d9804564f125cf23` is an ancestor of current `origin/main`, and the local
  path no longer exists.
- Reaped landed local branch refs `limen/org-hr-organ-charter-0704-2089` and
  `limen/org-social-organ-firstslice-0703-e618` with `python3 scripts/reap-branches.py --apply --force`
  after dry-run proof classified both as `landed-ancestor`.
- Refreshed the prompt lifecycle ledger with remote/cloud receipts enabled:
  `python3 scripts/prompt-lifecycle-ledger.py --write --all`. The private index now has
  `remote.enabled: true` and checked 1000 task PR refs.
- No worktree reclaim, force-push, merge, task-board mutation, or owner-repo source edit was
  performed in this pass.

2026-07-02 live-root reconciliation scan:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json`: 37 roots, 0 debt-bearing roots, cap 12.
- Current class mix: 14 active roots under the grace window, 14 open-PR remote-preserved
  roots, 6 merged-PR repair roots, and 3 owner-blocker roots.
- The seven roots that were debt-bearing at the start of this pass now have owner receipts in
  `docs/worktree-preservation-receipts.json`: six `.limen-repair/pr-*` roots are closed by
  merged Limen PR receipts whose live GitHub `headRefOid` equals local `HEAD`; the
  `gen-a-organvm-a-i-council--coliseum-ci-green-0620-29ec` root is kept visible as an
  owner-blocker because its `.git` file points at missing parent worktree metadata while PR
  #177 remains the owner review surface. A stale prompt-lifecycle remote-branch gap for
  absent root `mirror-mirror` is also closed by the merged PR #87 receipt.
- No local reclaim, deletion, force-push, merge, task-board mutation, or owner-repo source edit
  was performed in this pass.

Newly classified roots:

| Root | Repo | State | Evidence | Disposition | Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gen-a-organvm-a-i-council--coliseum-ci-green-0620-29ec` | `organvm/a-i-council--coliseum` | broken Git worktree; owner blocker | `.git` points to missing `/Users/4jp/Workspace/organvm/a-i-council--coliseum/.git/worktrees/gen-a-organvm-a-i-council--coliseum-ci-green-0620-29ec`; task `GEN-a-organvm-a-i-council--coliseum-ci-green-0620` is `done` via PR [#177](https://github.com/organvm/a-i-council--coliseum/pull/177); private non-cache file inventory receipt recorded under `.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/worktree-preserve/2026-07-02T220101Z-gen-a-organvm-a-i-council--coliseum-ci-green-0620-29ec/receipt.json` | owner-blocker receipt; not cache-only residue | Reclaim only after operator acceptance or after a fresh owner packet verifies PR/default-branch preservation from a valid checkout. |
| `pr-463` | `organvm/limen` | merged PR repair checkout | GitHub PR [#463](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/463) is `MERGED`; PR `headRefOid` `adb0911c13a77c9b492ffec1843398f6694b8376` equals local `HEAD` | remote-merged receipt; no local source debt remains | Reclaim local repair checkout only after normal operator acceptance. |
| `pr-466` | `organvm/limen` | merged PR repair checkout | GitHub PR [#466](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/466) is `MERGED`; PR `headRefOid` `3f25b5eee2d1964e3ffa68dd2ee42cae6e7ba53c` equals local `HEAD` | remote-merged receipt; no local source debt remains | Reclaim local repair checkout only after normal operator acceptance. |
| `pr-467` | `organvm/limen` | merged PR repair checkout | GitHub PR [#467](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/467) is `MERGED`; PR `headRefOid` `ae0568d214a470664dfdca07358e9c7239d84dc8` equals local `HEAD` | remote-merged receipt; no local source debt remains | Reclaim local repair checkout only after normal operator acceptance. |
| `pr-468` | `organvm/limen` | merged PR repair checkout | GitHub PR [#468](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/468) is `MERGED`; PR `headRefOid` `117b49213b4fbd77f4ded58e5ee6e09cc0982e54` equals local `HEAD` | remote-merged receipt; no local source debt remains | Reclaim local repair checkout only after normal operator acceptance. |
| `pr-471` | `organvm/limen` | merged PR repair checkout | GitHub PR [#471](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/471) is `MERGED`; PR `headRefOid` `73be2bf4b341c5f3d6b2ad3f5bc75c4e955e7074` equals local `HEAD` | remote-merged receipt; no local source debt remains | Reclaim local repair checkout only after normal operator acceptance. |
| `pr-475` | `organvm/limen` | merged PR repair checkout | GitHub PR [#475](https://github.com/organvm/limen/pull/475) is `MERGED`; PR `headRefOid` `63fa4486cb465f63beb0f431e6200a9dfab8d7e6` equals local `HEAD` | remote-merged receipt; no local source debt remains | Reclaim local repair checkout only after normal operator acceptance. |
| `mirror-mirror` | `organvm/mirror-mirror` | absent stale repo-local root; merged PR preserved | prompt-lifecycle index retained `/Users/4jp/Workspace/limen/.worktrees/mirror-mirror`; path is absent from live filesystem and `git worktree list`; GitHub PR [#87](https://github.com/organvm/mirror-mirror/pull/87) is `MERGED` with head `99fdd8d8b49e8a57022e6eec52b706655e973403` | remote-merged receipt; stale remote-branch gap closed | No local source preservation action remains; keep receipt so stale remote scans close. |

2026-06-28 follow-up scan:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json`: 14 roots, 0 debt-bearing roots, cap 12.
- Current class mix: 2 owner-blocker roots, 4 open-PR remote-preserved roots,
  3 documented residues, 2 remote-merged roots, 1 remote-superseded root, and
  2 clean+merged idle roots.
- The raw remote branch receipt still reports 7 present / 4 missing branch names, but the live
  scanner now closes all 4 missing names through owner-blocker, documented-residue,
  remote-superseded, or clean+merged-idle proof; unresolved missing branch gaps are 0.
- No local reclaim, deletion, merge, force-push, or owner-repo source mutation was performed in
  this follow-up. This receipt only updates the owner ledger so the active conductor tranche
  starts from live pressure instead of the older 8-debt summary. Four open draft PR roots now
  report as `remote-pr-open` after confirming their local HEADs exactly match their GitHub PR
  `headRefOid`s; this preserves the source remotely without claiming those PRs are merged or
  ready. Two previously debt-bearing roots now report as `owner-blocker` only because their
  preservation receipts include private patch receipts and SHA-256 evidence; this records
  owner intent and prevents duplicate dispatch, but still requires operator acceptance before
  local reclaim. The Sovereign generated-results root was reclassified as documented non-source
  residue after confirming the checkout is at `origin/main`, the only local deltas are 11
  tracked `structure-tests/results/*.json` snapshots, and the repo README describes the
  project as a parked docs-only shell. The
  Hierarchia root now reports as `remote-superseded` because its dirty import-order draft
  and untracked smoke test are covered by current `origin/main` tests and cleanup. Mirror
  Mirror PR #67 and Public Record Data Scraper PR #328 are now live GitHub `MERGED`
  receipts whose head OIDs match their local worktree heads.
- The active conductor packet is `docs/conductor-tranche.md`:
  `tranche-github-app-limen-bot-not-wired`. Its stop condition forbids creating/installing the
  GitHub App, calling `scripts/set-credential.sh`, writing PEM/key material, or changing GitHub
  secrets without explicit human approval.

The older scan notes below are retained as lineage for how these roots were classified and
preserved during the 2026-06-27 cleanup pass.

Evidence commands:

- `python3 scripts/worktree-debt.py --json`: 14 roots, 8 debt-bearing roots after five
  duplicate PR-preserved local worktrees were removed from `.limen-worktrees`.
- per-root `git status --porcelain`, `git log --oneline -5`, `git cherry <default> HEAD`.
- non-Git residue inspection with `find` and direct reads of cache metadata files.

Older cleanup-pass classes retained for lineage:

- 2 dirty working trees counted as debt.
- 3 local unpushed or remote-mismatched commit roots.
- 2 non-Git residue roots.
- 4 active roots inside the idle grace window.
- 1 clean root not merged to default, with a draft PR receipt.
- 2 clean, merged, idle roots.
- 5 remote-preserved draft-PR checkouts removed from local scan after exact
  local/remote commit equality was verified.

System pothole found during this pass: none of the 14 current root slugs appear directly
in `tasks.yaml`. The strongest origin receipt for most roots is therefore the
root/branch slug plus repo and recent commit/PR context, not a task-board entry.
That is not enough for a fully automatic lifecycle.

## Ledger

| Root | Repo | State | Origin Receipt | Evidence | Disposition | Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bld-domus-genoma-ci-23a9` | `organvm/domus-genoma` | local checkout removed; draft PR open | branch `limen/bld-domus-genoma-ci-23a9`; likely build/CI task; no exact task slug in board | clean before removal; local `HEAD` matched fetched PR head `c53a571`; PR [#144](https://github.com/organvm/domus-genoma/pull/144); untracked CI draft was rebased onto current `origin/master`; YAML parse passed; `git diff --check origin/master..HEAD` passed; `just --dry-run check-all` now shows `shfmt -d` and no `shfmt -w`; `just fmt-check` passed; full local `just check-all` exposed pre-existing BATS failures | remote PR preserved; no local debt root remains | Review PR CI and the known pre-existing BATS blockers, then merge or supersede by named branch/PR.

## Roadblocks And Potholes

- Worktree roots are not task-board addressable. The board has repo/task context, but the exact
  root slug is absent for all 14 current scanned roots.
- Non-Git residue bypasses git lifecycle checks. The two `the-invisible-ledger`
  residue roots needed direct filesystem inspection to classify.
- Patch-equivalent work looked unpushed until the debt scanner learned `git cherry`
  equivalence. That created false debt pressure around merged/squashed work.
- The latest single-file dirty root is now remote-preserved as draft PR
  [mirror-mirror#67](https://github.com/organvm/mirror-mirror/pull/67), and the
  scanner now classifies it as active instead of dirty debt.
- Five clean, duplicate local checkouts had open draft PRs with exact local/remote
  commit equality. Removing those local checkout copies dropped the scanner from
  19 roots / 16 debt to 14 roots / 11 debt without deleting unique work.
- The automated beat reclaimed two content-preserved roots immediately after classification.
  That did not lose unique source. On 2026-06-29 the operator policy was tightened in the
  other direction: `scripts/drain.sh` once defaulted `LIMEN_RECLAIM_APPLY=1`, but the reaper
  still refuses dirty, unique-unpushed, unmerged, active, or live/self roots.
- Dirty roots at default HEAD carry invisible work as uncommitted filesystem
  deltas. They need receipts before the system can reclaim or dispatch around them.
- `dispatch-parallel` can create and retire active roots while cleanup is reducing
  old lifecycle debt. That keeps the stream alive, but it can mask whether the
  system is actually draining net debt unless the final scan is authoritative.
- `domus-genoma` CI hardening surfaced pre-existing local `just check-all`
  failures: Brewfile manifest drift for `block-goose-cli`, a `#!/bin/bash`
  shebang in `lint_test.sh`, and multiple desktop-router BATS route failures.
- The Universal Mail Automation test-coverage root is a dangerous deletion shape:
  broad deletes with no ahead commits. A private patch receipt now preserves the exact
  deletion diff; it still needs owner classification before routine generated build-out resumes.
- Object Lessons PR #22 is no longer remote-close debt: the branch is patch-equivalent
  to default after PR #20, and GitHub closed #22 after the no-diff branch update.
- Public Record Data Scraper PR #328 was rebased onto current `origin/main`, its
  OpenAPI conflict was resolved by preserving the API-key/readiness surface plus the
  UCC response schema, and all GitHub checks passed.

## Drain Order

1. Close the two non-Git residue roots by keeping this classification visible; remove
   only after a scripted reclaim gate records the classification or the operator explicitly
   accepts that residue cleanup.
2. Drive the remaining open draft PR receipts to merge or named supersession:
   [domus-genoma#144](https://github.com/organvm/domus-genoma/pull/144),
   [mirror-mirror#67](https://github.com/organvm/mirror-mirror/pull/67),
   [conversation-corpus-engine#60](https://github.com/organvm/conversation-corpus-engine/pull/60),
   [a-i-chat--exporter#96](https://github.com/organvm/a-i-chat--exporter/pull/96),
   [a-i-chat--exporter#95](https://github.com/organvm/a-i-chat--exporter/pull/95),
   [public-record-data-scrapper#328](https://github.com/organvm/public-record-data-scrapper/pull/328),
   [kerygma-profiles#8](https://github.com/organvm/kerygma-profiles/pull/8), and
   [universal-mail--automation#108](https://github.com/organvm/universal-mail--automation/pull/108),
   plus [media-ark#50](https://github.com/organvm/media-ark/pull/50). PR
   [object-lessons#22](https://github.com/organvm/object-lessons/pull/22) is closed
   as a named default-branch supersession.
3. Work the dirty roots from lowest risk to highest risk: generated-only caches,
   remaining single-file deltas, multi-file implementation deltas, then the broad deletion root.
4. Keep the historical content-preserved reclaims visible as receipts; do not
   perform further local removals unless the target has exact remote/default
   preservation or explicit operator acceptance.
