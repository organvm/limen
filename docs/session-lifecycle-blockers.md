# Session Lifecycle Blockers

Generated: `2026-06-29T00:20:54+00:00`

## Canonical Handling

- Auth, login, secret, key, token, password, deploy-account, and provider-access issues are parked here unless a task explicitly scopes that account action.
- This receipt records handles and counts only. It does not read, print, repair, rotate, or commit secret values.
- A parked blocker is not cancelled work. It is a named owner lane that must be resolved or superseded before the dependent lifecycle can close.

## Intake Inputs

- Prompt lifecycle index present: `True` at `~/Workspace/limen-network-substrate-20260628/.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/prompt-lifecycle-index.json`.

- Codex classified sessions: `0`.
- Worktree debt roots: `0`.
- Remote receipts enabled: `True`; cloud receipts enabled: `True`.

- Local lifecycle footprint: `4.4 GiB`.
- Capability substrate detected: `11` roots, `1317` skill files, `45` plugin/MCP manifests.
- Capability resurfacing receipt present/current: `True`/`True`; activation candidates `30`.
- Local network substrate: status `healthy`, mode `observe`, route `en0` via `192.168.1.1`.
- Dispatch substrate: status `blocked`, launchd `running`, live root `feature/ORG-artist-organ-face-0628`, dirty entries `5`, async dry-run ok `True`.
- Live root gate: status `blocked`, branch `feature/ORG-artist-organ-face-0628`, unique commits `2`, dirty entries `5`, launchd env drift `1`.
- GitHub consolidation gate: `34` source repos, `13` collision groups, collision packet complete `True`, App token wired `False`.

## Parked / Hung Workstreams

- By category: `auth_credentials` 1, `cloud_runtime` 1, `dispatch_lifecycle` 1, `github_app_identity` 1, `github_consolidation` 1, `local_lean` 1.
- By status: `needs_human_gate` 3, `parked` 3.

| ID | Category | Status | Evidence | Owner | Route |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cloud-credential-handles-unconfigured` | `auth_credentials` | `parked` | 6 credential/deploy handles absent; 0 present. No values inspected. | credential workstream | Do not repair inline; open a bounded credential/setup workstream only when a cloud action requires it. |
| `cloud-runtime-endpoint-unconfigured` | `cloud_runtime` | `parked` | No runtime URL was configured for the last cloud receipt probe. | limen deployment workstream | Keep separate from session intake; configure/probe runtime only in a deploy/runtime task. |
| `local-lifecycle-disk-pressure` | `local_lean` | `parked` | Local lifecycle stores use 4.4 GiB (2.1 GiB worktrees, 2.3 GiB private corpus). | local lifecycle | Drain only after remote/default preservation proof or non-source residue receipt; keep pressure visible in SessionStart. |
| `dispatch-heartbeat-substrate-unhealthy` | `dispatch_lifecycle` | `needs_human_gate` | Dispatch-health receipt is `blocked` with 3 blocker(s): live-root-not-at-origin-main, live-root-dirty, heartbeat-loaded-env-drift. | dispatch heartbeat substrate | Use `docs/live-root-gate.md` to preserve/reconcile the live Limen root and reload launchd only under an explicit operator gate; stop before reset, branch switch, task-board edits, or async enablement. |
| `github-consolidation-collisions` | `github_consolidation` | `needs_human_gate` | 34 source repos remain outside `organvm`; 13 name-collision groups block the transfer apply gate. | GitHub consolidation | Collision packet is complete; await an explicit human GitHub mutation gate to run `docs/consolidation/COLLISION-RENAMES.md`, then re-run the consolidation dry-run and require 0 collisions before transfer. |
| `github-app-limen-bot-not-wired` | `github_app_identity` | `needs_human_gate` | `gh-app-token --which` resolves to `pat (GITHUB_TOKEN fallback)`; 4 org Apps are installed, and `limen[bot]` is not wired. | limen[bot] App identity | Create/install the org GitHub App and hydrate credentials via `scripts/set-credential.sh`; verify `bash scripts/gh-app-token.sh --which` reports the App path. |

## Private Output

- Private blocker index: `~/Workspace/limen-network-substrate-20260628/.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/session-lifecycle-blockers.json`.
- The private index keeps structured evidence and source paths, still without secret values or raw prompt text.
