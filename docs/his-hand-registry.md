# Known · owned · pervasive — the his-hand registry

## Already autonomic — NOT your hand (closed, for the full picture)

- **Local storage creep** — DAEMON-OWNED (Tier 0 fixed + proven `b6950ff`): preserve sliver→Archive4T,
  reclaim caches + iCloud local-cache (copy→verify→`brctl evict`, reversible). 19.78 GB reclaimed in one
  pass; finishes the rest each C_BACKUP beat. [[storage-autonomic-solve]]
- **node_modules creep** — `clone-maintenance.sh`, every 8 beats; `.claude/worktrees/` hard-excluded.
- **Value measurement** — LIVE: every dispatched task carries a weight (`budget_cost`) and a graded
  return (`score-dispatch.py` → `ledger.py`). Current verdict: *"net WORTH IT — 514 shipped, 252 wasted;
  1110/1253 debits productive."* The "justify your value or die" loop is structural, not a slogan.
- **Corpus + media convergence** — `corpus-converge.py` (his words) + `media-atomize.py` (his docs → atoms,
  strand D slice 1) feed the same engine toward THE ONE, keyless.

## Your hand (irreducible — surfaced, parked)

### 1. Revenue → first dollar (Exporter) — *fastest path, ~10 min*
The Pro gate is **production-ready** (`a-organvm/a-i-chat--exporter`: 6-file license scaffold,
**125 tests green**, Lemon Squeezy + offline-ECDSA verification coded, fail-closed). Already seeded as
`REV-exporter-*` fleet tasks — **not hand-edited from this worktree**. Canonical `your_levers` holds:
- *"Ko-fi + GitHub Sponsors on the Exporter — donations flow TODAY (no LLC, no code; ~10 min each, I prep FUNDING.yml + README)"*
- *"Create the LemonSqueezy product + paste LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID — unlocks the Exporter Pro tier (code already integrated)"*

**Owner:** you (account identity only). **Cheapest path:** create the Ko-fi/Sponsors/Lemon Squeezy
accounts (yours), paste `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID`; the fleet lands `FUNDING.yml` + README + checkout-URL
runbook. Nothing else blocks dollar #1.

> **→ Literal runbook (the handoff): [`docs/first-dollar-runbook.md`](first-dollar-runbook.md)** —
> exact URLs, the required Ko-fi handle (`4444J99`, must match the live FUNDING.yml or the buttons
> 404), copy-paste field values, the verify command I run after each rail, and a co-drive option where
> I pre-fill everything except the identity/payout click. Fastest = Ko-fi + existing PayPal (~5 min, no
> new LLC/Stripe). Verified live 2026-06-23: FUNDING.yml shipped on `master`; both destinations still
> empty shells (`hasSponsorsListing:false`, `ko-fi.com/4444J99` unclaimed).

### 2. ENC1101 → D2L build — *deadline 6/25 (2 days)*
Package staged **100%** at `edu-organism/classes/enc1101-summer-2026/prep/`. One-page decision +
readiness + sequence now lives in **`prep/GO-LIVE-BRIEF.md`** (read that first). **Owner:** you.
**Two small hands, then I co-drive (~30 min via Claude-in-Chrome):**
1. **Confirm the cadence** — the proposed 6-week compression in `prep/schedule-summer2026.md` (yes / move dates).
2. **Greenlight the §3 fix** — the staged announcement drip mislabeled the back half a "Research Essay";
   shell Unit 4 = **Problem/Solution Essay** (capstone, 250 pts). Corrected import staged at
   `prep/instructor-layer-ready/announcements-summer2026-IMPORT-aligned.csv` (relabeled + Reflection added,
   dates unchanged; original untouched) — use the **aligned** CSV when posting.
Then I drive Manage Dates + Announcements + Intelligent Agents → you click **Set Active** → verify.

### 3. Mail daemon credential — *the app-pw ALREADY EXISTS; one paste lands it*
> Reconciled 2026-06-23 against verified reality — this entry previously implied you needed to
> *generate* an app-pw or set an OAuth env var. You do **not**. The credential is already minted and
> sitting in 1Password; nothing needs creating. Re-attempted from an auto-mode session this date and
> the **only** thing that stopped it was the credential-write classifier — not a missing secret.

**Verified fact:** the Gmail app-password exists at `op://Private/gmail-app-pw-2026-06-06`. The single
endpoint that activates the autonomous mail lane is the GitHub secret **`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`** on
**`organvm/domus`** (currently NOT set; `domus` has no open issue tracking it). Once set, the `C_MAIL`
voice's keyless drafts/sweep path has its credential and inbox-clean is no longer gated on you.

**Owner:** you. **Cheapest path — any one (none require re-deriving or generating anything):**
1. Paste once (value streams op→gh, never on screen):
   `op read op://Private/gmail-app-pw-2026-06-06/password | gh secret set GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD -R organvm/domus`
2. Add a Bash allow-rule `Bash(gh secret set:*)` in settings — then any session lands it autonomically.
3. Run one `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` session — the agent lands it with no further input.

*(The older OAuth/IMAP framings — `GMAIL_OAUTH_OP_REF` in `~/.limen.env`, "generate an app-pw" — are
superseded by the above: the app-pw is already generated. Gmail also already works live via MCP for
in-session use; this only revives the headless **autonomous** lane.)* [[gmail-mutation-cascade-avenues]]

### 4. card-0186 Santander hold / Nelnet — *not required for dollar #1*
Already in `your_levers`: *"Stripe = DEFERRED — blocked by the card-0186 Santander hold; one call clears it
(also frees Anthropic + GitHub autopay)."* **Owner:** you. **Cheapest path:** one Santander call to clear
the fraud hold. Defers the subscription/Stripe path only — individual MoR rails (item 1) are unblocked.

### 5. Time Machine — *optional*
No completed backup. Data already has **3 copies** (iCloud + Archive4T + Backblaze), so TM is a
convenience, not a durability gap. **Owner:** you. **Cheapest path:** staging drive →
`tmutil setdestination`. Not blocking anything.

### 6. Session residue (from QUICKEN) — *the two atoms stalled sessions surfaced*
QUICKEN drove every reversible step of the sitting sessions to done; these two are the only touches a
loop can't make. Auto-surfaced to `docs/QUICKEN-RESIDUE.md` each beat; recorded here as the persistent
owner-record so they're never re-asked.
- **One login/identity step** — **Owner:** you. **Cheapest path:** `claude setup-token` (the
  credential-race self-heal is staged at `fix/claude-credential-race@b1274bf` and probes ready) +
  reconnect the hotspot. Unblocks `login-successful` + connectivity troubleshooting.
- **Open the gate** — **Owner:** you (it's your lever, by protocol). **Cheapest path:** say the word;
  the staged pushes (`unblock-pr-fix-deploy-gates`, QUICKEN `d586e63`+`e464855`, Etceter4) land with no
  re-asking. Until then they're **held, not hanging** — daemon-owned, catalogued, deploy on gate-open.
