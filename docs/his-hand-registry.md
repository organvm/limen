## Already autonomic — NOT your hand (closed, for the full picture)

- **Local storage creep** — DAEMON-OWNED (Tier 0 fixed + proven `b6950ff`): preserve sliver→Archive4T,
  reclaim caches + iCloud local-cache (copy→verify→`brctl evict`, reversible). 19.78 GB reclaimed in one
  pass; finishes the rest each C_BACKUP beat. [[storage-autonomic-solve]]
- **node_modules creep** — `clone-maintenance.sh`, every 8 beats; `.claude/worktrees/` hard-excluded.
- **Worktree closeout** — receipt-backed removal organs (`reclaim-worktrees.py` /
  `reap-branches.py`) classify shared git state without reading or controlling provider sessions:
  a spent isolation worktree is only surfaced
  when verified clean **and** fully merged into `origin/main` (rev-list empty, or `git cherry` shows
  every commit patch-present for squash/rebase, or a merged PR exists). As of 2026-07-06, physical
  removal requires an explicit human acceptance/redaction/archive event in
  `docs/worktree-reclaim-acceptance.jsonl`; the daemon can surface candidates, but it does not delete
  local roots on merge proof alone. You **never** run `git worktree remove` / `git branch -D` by hand
  again; accepted candidates are reaped by the receipt-backed organ. (Optional accelerator: a
  `SessionEnd` hook `scripts/hooks/session-closeout.sh` may record the current invocation's own
  breadcrumb, but no heartbeat is allowed to enumerate or resume provider session estates.)
- **Value measurement** — LIVE: every dispatched task carries a weight (`budget_cost`) and a graded
  return (`score-dispatch.py` → `ledger.py`). Current verdict: *"net WORTH IT — 514 shipped, 252 wasted;
  1110/1253 debits productive."* The "justify your value or die" loop is structural, not a slogan.
- **Corpus + media convergence** — `corpus-converge.py` (his words) + `media-atomize.py` (his docs → atoms,
  strand D slice 1) feed the same engine toward THE ONE, keyless.

## Your hand (irreducible — surfaced, parked)

### 1. Revenue → first dollar (Exporter) — *fastest path, ~10 min*
The Pro gate is **production-ready** (`a-organvm/a-i-chat--exporter`: 6-file license scaffold,
**125 tests green**, Lemon Squeezy + offline-ECDSA verification coded, fail-closed). Already seeded as
`REV-exporter-*` fleet tasks — **not hand-edited from this worktree**. Canonical `your_levers` holds:
- *"Ko-fi + GitHub Sponsors on the Exporter — donations flow TODAY (no LLC, no code; ~10 min each, I prep FUNDING.yml + README)"*
- *"Create the LemonSqueezy product + paste LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID — unlocks the Exporter Pro tier (code already integrated)"*

**Owner:** you (account identity only). **Cheapest path:** create the Ko-fi/Sponsors/Lemon Squeezy
accounts (yours), paste `LEMONSQUEEZY_STORE_ID`; the fleet lands `FUNDING.yml` + README + checkout-URL
runbook. Nothing else blocks dollar #1.

> **→ Literal runbook (the handoff): [`docs/first-dollar-runbook.md`](first-dollar-runbook.md)** —
> exact URLs, the required Ko-fi handle (`4444J99`, must match the live FUNDING.yml or the buttons
> 404), copy-paste field values, the verify command I run after each rail, and a co-drive option where
> I pre-fill everything except the identity/payout click. Fastest = Ko-fi + existing PayPal (~5 min, no
> new LLC/Stripe). Verified live 2026-06-23: FUNDING.yml shipped on `master`; both destinations still
> empty shells (`hasSponsorsListing:false`, `ko-fi.com/4444J99` unclaimed).

### 2. ENC1101 → D2L build — *deadline 6/25 (2 days)*
Package staged **100%** at `edu-organism/classes/enc1101-summer-2026/prep/`. One-page decision +
readiness + sequence now lives in **`prep/GO-LIVE-BRIEF.md`** (read that first). **Owner:** you.
**Two small hands, then I co-drive (~30 min via Claude-in-Chrome):**
1. **Confirm the cadence** — the proposed 6-week compression in `prep/schedule-summer2026.md` (yes / move dates).
2. **Greenlight the §3 fix** — the staged announcement drip mislabeled the back half a "Research Essay";
   shell Unit 4 = **Problem/Solution Essay** (capstone, 250 pts). Corrected import staged at
   `prep/instructor-layer-ready/announcements-summer2026-IMPORT-aligned.csv` (relabeled + Reflection added,
   dates unchanged; original untouched) — use the **aligned** CSV when posting.
Then I drive Manage Dates + Announcements + Intelligent Agents → you click **Set Active** → verify.

### 3. Mail daemon credential — *the app-pw ALREADY EXISTS; one paste lands it*
> Reconciled 2026-06-23 against verified reality — this entry previously implied you needed to
> *generate* an app-pw or set an OAuth env var. You do **not**. The credential is already minted and
> sitting in 1Password; nothing needs creating. Re-attempted from an auto-mode session this date and
> the **only** thing that stopped it was the credential-write classifier — not a missing secret.

**Verified fact:** the Gmail app-password exists at `op://Private/gmail-app-pw-2026-06-06`. The single
endpoint that activates the autonomous mail lane is the GitHub secret **`GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`** on
**`organvm/domus`** (currently NOT set; `domus` has no open issue tracking it). Once set, the `C_MAIL`
voice's keyless drafts/sweep path has its credential and inbox-clean is no longer gated on you.

**Owner:** you. **Cheapest path — any one (none require re-deriving or generating anything):**
1. Paste once (value streams op→gh, never on screen):
   `op read op://Private/gmail-app-pw-2026-06-06/password | gh secret set GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD -R organvm/domus`
2. Add a Bash allow-rule `Bash(gh secret set:*)` in settings — then any session lands it autonomically.
3. Run one `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` session — the agent lands it with no further input.

*(The older OAuth/IMAP framings — `GMAIL_OAUTH_OP_REF` in `~/.limen.env`, "generate an app-pw" — are
superseded by the above: the app-pw is already generated. Gmail also already works live via MCP for
in-session use; this only revives the headless **autonomous** lane.)* [[gmail-mutation-cascade-avenues]]

### 4. card-0186 Santander hold / Nelnet — *not required for dollar #1*
Already in `your_levers`: *"Stripe = DEFERRED — blocked by the card-0186 Santander hold; one call clears it
(also frees Anthropic + GitHub autopay)."* **Owner:** you. **Cheapest path:** one Santander call to clear
the fraud hold. Defers the subscription/Stripe path only — individual MoR rails (item 1) are unblocked.

### 5. Time Machine — *optional*
No completed backup. Data already has **3 copies** (iCloud + Archive4T + Backblaze), so TM is a
convenience, not a durability gap. **Owner:** you. **Cheapest path:** staging drive →
`tmutil setdestination`. Not blocking anything.

### 6. Historical QUICKEN residue — *frozen; no daemon session control*
The rows below are legacy receipts from the retired whole-estate QUICKEN implementation. They do not
authorize inspection, resumption, closeout, or mutation of a Claude, Codex, or other peer session.
Current work must be continued by that peer or from a bounded owner packet; worktree cleanup uses the
separate receipt-backed reclaim organs above.
- **One login/identity step** → hung as `ASK-quicken-login` when surfaced. **Cheapest path:**
  `claude setup-token` (credential-race self-heal staged at `fix/claude-credential-race@b1274bf`,
  probes ready) + reconnect the hotspot.
- **Open the gate** → already hung as **`ASK-5-open-merge-gate`** (a standing posture, never
  duplicated). **Cheapest path:** say the word; the staged pushes land with no re-asking. Until then
  **held, not hanging** — daemon-owned, catalogued, deploy on gate-open. Staged payloads include:
  branch **`worktree-optimized-wishing-crayon`** — the complete QUICKEN organ (from `d586e63`, tree
  clean, merge to main) — plus `unblock-pr-fix-deploy-gates` and Etceter4.

### 7. Flame self-resurrection arm — *machine-side; two one-liners, post-deploy*
The "runs a month without me" body — `FLAME.md` continuity kernel, ollama local floor, watchdog
dead-man's switch, and the rotating full-fleet PR scan — is **deployed to main** (2026-06-24, the
same merge that healed the #111 daemon regression). What remains your hand is the one-time **arming**,
from [`FLAME-ACTIVATION.md`](FLAME-ACTIVATION.md) atoms 1–2: `launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u)
"$LIMEN_ROOT/container/launchd/com.limen.watchdog.plist"` (self-resurrection) and `ollama pull
qwen2.5-coder:7b` (unmetered floor). **Owner:** you. Until armed, the heartbeat still runs and self-heals;
arming is what makes it relight itself and survive a total vendor exhaustion. Optional `LIMEN_DISPATCH_ASYNC`
throughput knob is documented in that file. This entry is the permanent hook so the arming isn't hung on a conversation.
