# Session Attack Paths

Generated: `2026-06-29T03:28:15+00:00`

## Canonical Decision

- Do not assign Jules, Gemini, Agy, OpenCode, or Claude broad sprawl prompts.
- Attack order comes from corpus evidence: prompt recurrence, local disk pressure, preservation risk, remote proof, blocker status, and agent fit.
- Auth/secrets/login/key/password/provider-access work stays parked unless directly required by a scoped path.
- Local substrate incidents such as network/LaunchAgent failures are not lane-local noise: patch once, record a reusable receipt, then make the blocker visible to every lane.
- Local cleanup comes after preservation proof: pushed branch, open/merged PR, default-branch equivalence, owner blocker, or documented non-source residue.

## Coverage

- Redacted prompt corpus: `9621` files, `96220` prompt-like events.
- Codex classified sessions: `931`.
- Worktree debt roots: `0`.
- Worktree preservation receipts: `14`.
- Parked blockers: `7`.
- Local lifecycle footprint: `4.6 GiB`.
- Candidate lanes: `family` 7, `human-gate` 17, `parked` 5.

## Ordering Model

- Highest priority: system clogs that prevent the lifecycle machine from draining: broken hooks, invalid states, missing preservation receipts, stale remote proof, or owner ledgers that make downstream cleanup unsafe.
- Network/environment substrate failures outrank ordinary repo cleanup because they can make every agent misclassify auth, dispatch, and GitHub symptoms.
- Next: dirty or non-Git local roots with prompt evidence and missing remote preservation, because they consume disk and risk unique work.
- Worktree receipts that require operator acceptance before reclaim are human-gated, not autonomous lane work.
- Then: open remote-proof lanes where local copies can become lean after PR/default evidence is checked.
- Then: repeated lifecycle/family loops that need owner packets before delegation.
- Credential/auth lanes stay parked unless they are the direct clog blocking the selected path; then prepare only the bounded non-secret setup or human handoff.

## Ranked Paths

The branch is ahead 10 and behind 43 against origin/main, has no open/closed PR, and its HEAD patch targets .github/workflows/gemini-review.yml, .github/workflows/version-control-standards.yml, dashboard TS shim files, and tsconfig.json, while current origin/main only has ci-minimal, dependabot-auto-merge, dispatch-receiver, and stale workflows. Preserve as private patch evidence; if needed, create a new narrow owner packet to cherry-pick only the Limen automation branch-policy idea into the current organvm/.github default tree. |

## Delegation Gate

- A path may be assigned only when it has an owner repo or owner ledger, a bounded next action, no raw-secret dependency, and a verification predicate or blocker receipt.
- Claude is a context source while near limit; it should not be the default executor.
- Jules/OpenCode/Agy get packets only after the ranked path is narrowed to a repo, branch, predicate, and expected receipt.
- Gemini stays parked if auth is not already repaired.

## Private Output

- Private attack-path index: `~/Workspace/limen-main-trench-20260628/.limen-private/session-corpus/lifecycle/session-attack-paths.json`.
- The private index keeps structured path evidence from redacted indexes; it contains no raw prompt text.
