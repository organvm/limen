# SPECVLVM — the contributions mirror

> Outward to learn inward: each upstream is a lens on wiring worth absorbing; community and
> name recognition accrue as byproducts of genuine value. Rendered by
> `scripts/contributions-organ.py` from hub-ledger outputs only (PLAN-06 owner packet 04 —
> limen is the owner surface). **Nothing here sends** — every outbound act is the human's hand.

## Lifecycle (the audit of `LIFECYCLE.md`)

Staleness rule: an open PR untouched since before 2026-06-25 (14d before the source stamp) renders protocol-due — a bump is owed, staged,
and fired one-at-a-time by the human hand (never batch-bumped).

**Lifecycle debt — 7 workspace(s) reap-owed** (terminal PR, no recorded closeout:
archive the tracking repo, settle the fork, mark the ledger entry closed-out):

- `a-organvm/contrib--a2aproject-a2a-python` — closed
- `a-organvm/contrib--adenhq-hive` — closed

## The autopoietic pool — inward-derived outward opportunities

The scout limb walked our own dependency manifests: these are the upstreams we lean on
hardest and have never engaged — the next places to study wiring. Pooled for
scout/fieldwork vetting; adoption and every send stay human-gated.

| dependency | used across our repos |
|---|---|
| pytest | 38 |
| typescript | 35 |
| vitest | 27 |
| ruff | 25 |
| eslint | 24 |
| pyyaml | 23 |
| react | 16 |
| node | 15 |
| react-dom | 15 |
| pytest-cov | 13 |
| js | 12 |
| jsdom | 11 |

## Estate register (`ESTATE.yaml`)

42 artifacts registered — 38 verified present locally, 3 cited (remote/receipt), 0 DRIFT, 1 optional-absent.

_Optional-absent (expected): `hub-seed-root`_

## The estate this mirror reflects

- Hub: `organvm/contrib` (generated LEDGER; state surface)
- Engines: `organvm_engine.contrib` (A) + `contrib_engine/` in orchestration-start-here (B)
- Workspaces: the `contrib--*` tracking repos, one per upstream
- Rules: `organs/contributions/LIFECYCLE.md` · Register: `organs/contributions/ESTATE.yaml`
- Charter: `organs/contributions/CHARTER.md` · Kernel: `organs/contributions/KERNEL.md`
