# Publication Policy — the disclosure court

**One question, one answer, every repo.** For any piece of content, *"does this belong on
this repo, and in what form?"* is not a per-file human judgment — it is a lookup in a fixed
rule table. This organ is that table plus the engine that reads it, so the answer is always
clear and never re-litigated.

- **Engine:** [`scripts/publication-policy.py`](../../scripts/publication-policy.py)
- **Tests / predicate:** [`cli/tests/test_publication_policy.py`](../../cli/tests/test_publication_policy.py) + `publication-policy.py --verify`
- **Beat:** `C_PUBPOLICY` (heartbeat) → `--verify` each cycle → stamps `logs/publication-policy-state.json` → proprioception rung `PUBPOLICY` → advances this organ's `organ-ladder.json` maturity when objective checks pass.

## The decision

Two inputs. **Repo visibility** (`public` | `private`) and **content class**, classified
path-first then by content:

| class | what it is |
|---|---|
| `secret` | tokens / keys / credentials / `.env` / `*.pem` — or content matching a secret shape |
| `personal_pii` | an ordinary doc carrying the **owner's** identifiers (name / handle / home-path / convo-link) |
| `internal_strategy` | raw session dumps (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-*`), prompt archives, `docs/planning/`, premortems, transcripts |
| `product_content` | app/source code + its fixtures (product contacts, UI placeholders, `555`/`example.com` fakes) |
| `public_safe` | everything else (README, curated docs, data) |

### The disposition matrix

| content ↓ / repo → | **PUBLIC** | **PRIVATE** |
|---|---|---|
| `secret` | `REMOVE_ROTATE` | `REMOVE_ROTATE` |
| `personal_pii` | `REDACT_IDENTIFIERS` | `REDACT_IDENTIFIERS` |
| `internal_strategy` | **`KEEP_OFF_PUBLIC_HEAD`** | `RESTORE_REDACT` |
| `product_content` | **`LEAVE`** | `LEAVE` |
| `public_safe` | `PUBLISH` *(his click)* | `PUBLISH` *(his click)* |

## The doctrine it encodes

1. **PII is processed and redacted, never deleted.** Owner identifiers are scrubbed; all
   substance is preserved. Redaction is **owner-scoped only** — it never uses a category-wide
   `@domain` / any-phone wildcard. That bare wildcard was the 2026-07 over-redaction bug (it ate
   `legal@styx.protocol`, `you@styx.protocol`, `partner@example.com`, and the fiction-reserved
   `555` fixtures, breaking product builds + tests). The engine's redactor is scoped to the
   `OWNER` config and nothing else. See [`DISCLOSURE-AUDIT.md`](DISCLOSURE-AUDIT.md).
2. **Secrets are never restored anywhere.** They are removed; rotation is the credential organ +
   a vendor mint (his hand). See [`scripts/creds-hydrate.py`](../../scripts/creds-hydrate.py) (the
   credential organ that mints + verifies — the `_SECRET_RX` pattern is the canonical firewall
   mirrored in this engine).
3. **Subject-matter-sensitive content stays off the public HEAD.** Internal strategy, raw session
   artifacts, and named third parties on a *public* surface are kept **off the live HEAD** —
   preserved in git **history** (never deleted from the universe), just not on the face. On a
   *private* repo the same content is a safe restore-and-redact. Identifier-redaction cannot
   neutralize sensitive *subject matter*, only sensitive *identifiers*.
4. **Autonomy is derived from reversibility** (the Censor's constitution — see
   [`scripts/heartbeat-loop.sh`](../../scripts/heartbeat-loop.sh) for the beat cadence and the
   `his_lever`/`auto` autonomy split in the disposition matrix):
   reversible/protective → `auto`; **publish / flip-visibility / send → his hand** (the media-pillar
   boundary "mine, but the publish click is his").

## Convergence table — every scattered gate references THIS rule table

The content-safety surface was built as several independent gates. This table maps each
to its single row in the disposition matrix so any future change starts here, not in a
new gate:

| Scattered gate | File | What it guards | Converges to (rule-table row) | Autonomy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_SECRET_RX` | `scripts/creds-hydrate.py:455` | Secret-shaped strings in credential output + content | `secret` × any vis → `REMOVE_ROTATE` | `his_lever` (rotation is a vendor mint) |
| `SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` | `scripts/scan-legacy-session-batch.py:37` | Keyword-based session-content classification for legacy review batch | `internal_strategy` (path-first classifier in engine supersedes keyword classification) | `auto` (classification, not action) |
| `persona contracts` | `spec/contracts/surface-manifest.schema.json` | WHO may see WHAT on WHICH surface (persona-based surface gating) | Complementary: disposition matrix decides CONTENT safety; persona contracts decide AUDIENCE access. Both must agree before content reaches a surface. | mixed |
| `awaiting_publish` | `scripts/generate-positioning.py:93` | Repo-level publish gate: banked + tested positioning seeds kept OFF all public surfaces | `public_safe` × `PUBLIC` → `PUBLISH` (his_lever). The `awaiting_publish` flag IS the `his_lever` manifestation: he flips the repo public and clears the flag, then disposition allows `PUBLISH`. | `his_lever` (the publish click is his) |

**Protocol:** every new content-safety concern enters the engine (classifier + disposition)
first — never a standalone gate. If a new gate is unavoidable, it must reference this table
as its authority and be added to the table above.

## How a repo / sweep defers

Instead of judging each file, ask the engine:

```bash
python3 scripts/publication-policy.py classify <path> --visibility public
python3 scripts/publication-policy.py audit ledger.json           # a whole estate at once
python3 scripts/publication-policy.py redact <path> --apply       # owner-scoped only
python3 scripts/publication-policy.py --verify                    # is the engine still sound?
```

The 2026-07-02 PII-sweep re-audit was resolved *by this engine* — see
[`DISCLOSURE-AUDIT.md`](DISCLOSURE-AUDIT.md) for the per-repo disposition ledger it produced.

## Self-feed

The publication-policy beat is not just a smoke test. `scripts/publication-policy.py --verify`
assesses the rank-10 `Publication Policy` organ from repo-local criteria: engine soundness,
test coverage, heartbeat wiring, proprioception wiring, parameter registration, and whether the
legacy gates above all point back to this rule table. When the assessed maturity exceeds the
stored maturity, it updates only the `Publication Policy` entry in `organ-ladder.json` through a
mkdir lock plus atomic replace. It never touches `tasks.yaml`, never dispatches work, and never
lowers maturity.

The remaining 20% is intentionally held behind the estate cleanup in
[`DISCLOSURE-AUDIT.md`](DISCLOSURE-AUDIT.md): verified/stripped public-HEAD residuals, resolved
inferred cases, and external/his-hand residues.
