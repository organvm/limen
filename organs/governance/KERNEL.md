# Governance Organism — KERNEL (Aerarium / Cvrsvs Honorvm)

> **Boundary (load-bearing, repeated everywhere in this organ):** this is governance *infrastructure*
> that AUGMENTS human decision-makers and legal counsel. It does **not** constitute legal authority,
> ratify binding resolutions, or replace board judgment. Every entity formation signature, governance
> vote, and formal resolution stays with the human fiduciaries. The organ tracks, validates, and
> enforces the rules they adopt — so the institution runs correctly between their decisions.

## Why this organ exists

Well-governed institutions don't stay accountable because their founders were trustworthy — they stay
accountable because a *system* stands behind them: a sequence of roles that must be held before
authority escalates, a record of who decided what and when, an auditor that catches skipped steps, a
register that proves the entity is what it claims to be. Without that system, a founder's good
intentions are the only guardrail. This organ builds the system.

The rival institution is a constitutional state's governance office or a foundation board: a body with
standing rules, a verifiable sequence of offices, and a paper trail anyone can audit. This organ
delivers that institutional weight — the **cursus honorum standard** — as a coordinated set of AI
roles holding the infrastructure between human decisions.

## Constitutional authority and operational projection

The ratified CORPVS governance testament owns directives, axioms, instruments, ideal forms,
amendments, supersession, and their source lineage. Limen does not mirror that authority. This organ
consumes the configured `governance-testament.v1` owner receipt plus matching graph and coverage
receipts, schedules finite reversible work, and publishes a redacted operational projection. Its
legacy local canon remains a compatibility pointer to that owner record.

The projection fails visibly: missing, malformed, inaccessible, quarantined, or snapshot-mismatched
inputs remain named debt. An empty local path or dashboard count can never prove that a source does
not exist. Operator-intent and artifact timelines remain separate, and assistant prose has no
operator authority without an explicit adoption event.

## The 5-primitive kernel, mapped to the governance domain

| Primitive | Governance meaning | Concretely |
|---|---|---|
| **Member** | the entity / contributor | the person or organization whose standing in the system is tracked; their role, capacity, and office history |
| **Mandate** | the office / authority | the specific power or duty conferred at the current stage of the sequence; what this office-holder may decide |
| **Standing** | cursus posture | where in the sequence the member currently sits: which offices have been held, what prerequisites are satisfied, what is next |
| **Standard** | the governing rule | the constitutional rule, sequence invariant, or precedent that constrains advancement; the machine-checkable law |
| **Governance** | the senate / board | who ratifies promotions, how disputes are resolved, what stays irreducibly in the human's hand |

This is the *same* kernel as the legal, education, health, and artist organs — only the skin changes.
That is the fractal: one structure, every pillar.

## Fractal deployment

- **MACRO** — a portable governance-as-code open standard anyone can adopt: seed-contract validation,
  promotion state-machine enforcement, entity-register integrity, dual-entity boundary enforcement,
  and a standing-record registry. Any multi-repo ecosystem or dual-entity organization can adopt it
  as its governance floor. See [`MACRO-FACE.md`](MACRO-FACE.md).

- **MICRO** — ORGANVM's own dual-entity operation: the open-project commons (non-profit Cind & Sol
  Foundation, Panama) and the commercial vehicle (Sovereign Systems LLC). The organ tracks their
  respective mandates, ensures the entities do not blur fiduciary roles, and runs the cursus-honorum
  sequence for every contributor repo. Both entities pass the entity-integrity validator on every
  beat. See [`MICRO-FACE.md`](MICRO-FACE.md).

## The cursus honorum (the sequence of offices)

The Roman cursus honorum was the sequential ladder of public offices — no one could hold the consulship
without first holding the quaestorship and praetorship. This organ expresses that same invariant for
repositories and contributors:

```
INCUBATOR → ALPHA → BETA → STABLE → MATURE
```

A repo cannot claim STABLE without having passed through INCUBATOR, ALPHA, and BETA. A contributor
cannot hold an authority without the prerequisite standing. The machine checks; the human ratifies.

## Hard guardrails (every contributor + every dispatched task)

- No self-ratification. The organ audits governance; it does not govern. Final decisions — entity
  formation, formal resolutions, promotion ratification — stay with the human fiduciaries.
- No irreversible entity action without his gate. Filings, signatures, and binding commitments are
  staged and surfaced; the organ never acts on them.
- The cursus is public and auditable. The sequence of offices and the audit log are durable records,
  not chat memory. What is not written down does not count.
- Do not skip stages, even under pressure. A skipped stage in the cursus honorum is a governance
  failure. Surface it; do not paper over it.
- Do not self-ratify or fall back to local doctrine when the configured constitutional owner receipt
  is missing. Preserve the blocker and continue every unrelated reversible lane.

## Validation

```bash
# Rules #1-2: cursus office integrity + structured edges
python organs/governance/validate-seed.py --fleet --strict-graph

# Rules #3-4: entity register integrity + repo registration
python organs/governance/validate-entities.py --fleet
```

Both validators exit 0 when the organ's own house is in order. Run them on every governance beat.
