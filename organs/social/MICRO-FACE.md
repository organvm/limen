## Why these engagements

The platform has to work for more than one kind of tie. Each engagement tests a
different relationship type and a different stress vector:

| Engagement | Relationship type | Stress test |
|---|---|---|
| Derek | Collaborator, client, creative partner | Multi-dimensional tie spanning professional and personal — tests whether the posture brief captures both without flattening either |
| (next) | Family | Ties with deep history, implicit obligations, and high emotional stakes — tests whether the organ holds sensitive care patterns without overstepping |
| (next) | Collaborative network | The web of contributors, patrons, and peers — tests whether the registry scales beyond one-to-one ties |

The first engagement is Derek. It proves the brief. The next engagements prove the fleet.

## Fleet standing

| Person | Relationship | Standing | Next gate | Owner of gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Derek | Collaborator, client, creative partner | ACTIVE | Dashboard review and brief confirmation | Anthony |

No engagement has autonomous outbound action open. No messages, invitations, care
actions, or relationship changes move without human review.

## Engagement 1: Derek — creative collaborator and client

**What this proves:** the posture brief can hold a multi-dimensional tie —
professional collaboration, paid client engagement, and creative partnership —
without reducing it to any one dimension.

**Mandate:** collaborative narrative work and sovereign-systems client delivery.
The tie spans creative output (narrative workshop, Beowulf Fitts composition),
professional services (consulting delivery through Sovereign Systems LLC), and
personal creative partnership (shared aesthetic sensibility, long-form
collaboration).

**What exists now:**

- Complete Relationship-Posture Brief in `engagements/derek.yaml`
- Generated brief in `engagements/derek-brief.md`
- Generated triage view in `engagements/triage-dashboard.md`
- ACTIVE standing with strong warmth — high-care tie
- Reciprocity norm: reply within 24h on active threads; weekly check-in cadence
  during active projects; annual gratitude/reflection note
- Clear human gates: every project deliverable reviewed before delivery; every
  introduction or referral staged for Anthony's approval; any conflict or repair
  surfaced directly
- Governance: all project-specific data lives in the consulting organ; Derek's
  personal relationship record is private and never shared

**Next proof step:**

Review the relationship-posture report and triage dashboard with Anthony.
Then add the next engagement (family tie) to prove the fleet.

## What the first engagement proves

1. **The posture model holds for multi-dimensional ties.** Member, Mandate, Standing,
   Standard, and Governance capture a relationship that spans professional, creative,
   and personal dimensions without flattening the human being to a contact record.
2. **The human gate is structural.** Every outbound act — deliverable review, referral,
   introduction — stays with Anthony. Nothing leaves the system without his hand.
3. **The infrastructure is not the relationship.** The brief documents the care pattern;
   it does not claim to own the friendship, predict the other person's needs, or
   optimize the tie for extraction.
4. **Consent and privacy are architectural.** Derek's record is private; only the
   posture fields that the relationship itself requires are tracked. Project-specific
   data is scoped to the consulting organ.

## Validation

Run:

```bash
python organs/social/validate-social.py --fleet
python organs/social/scripts/relationship-brief.py organs/social/engagements/derek.yaml
python organs/social/scripts/triage-dashboard.py
```

Expected result: the engagement passes all six social organ rules, produces a
relationship-posture report, and generates a fleet-wide triage dashboard.
