# Legal Organism — CHARTER (COCHRAN, the virtual firm)

> **Boundary:** an AI-run legal *operations* firm that works under and for a licensed attorney. It does
> not practice law or give legal advice. The attorney of record directs it and owns every output. See
> [KERNEL.md](KERNEL.md) for the full guardrails and [FRAMEWORK-FOR-MICAH.md](FRAMEWORK-FOR-MICAH.md) for
> the client-facing deck. **Current maturity:** scaffold. This charter defines buildable workflows and
> reviewable artifacts; it does not claim an autonomous law practice or a deployed production firm.

## What it rivals — the Cochran standard

Anthony named this flagship legal organ **Cochran**: not a claim of affiliation, and not a promise of
legal representation, but the institutional standard it must rival. A top-tier litigation firm like
Cochran's doesn't have better lawyers; it has **more bench**. For every hour the named partner spends in
court or on strategy, a coordinated team spends dozens of hours on the work that makes that hour
effective: evidence indexing, research, calendaring, drafting, chain-of-custody discipline. The solo
practitioner or lean firm has the same legal skill but **none of the bench**.

This organ supplies that bench as persistent AI roles expressed as repeatable workflows. In the scaffold
stage, those workflows can be run manually by a conductor or scheduled by Limen beats; each run produces
local artifacts for attorney review. It does not replace the attorney — it replaces the missing
operations headcount that multiplies the attorney's effective output.

The Cochran standard, distilled: **every fact is found before it is needed, every deadline is owned before
it arrives, and every argument is built on an evidence base that is complete and current.** This organ
makes that the default operating state for one attorney handling any matter.

## Institutional weight — how idle fleet capacity becomes a firm

VLTIMA's fleet produces 14K-16K idle AI workunits per month. This organ converts that spare capacity
into ongoing case operations. The mapping:

| Fleet idle capacity (supply) | → | Legal organ demand |
|---|---|---|
| Unlimited cheap reads + writes | → | Continuous evidence indexing, re-indexing as new docs arrive |
| Background processing beats | → | Daily standing updates, deadline proximity alerts, calendar maintenance |
| Research-oriented models | → | Statute/precedent pulls, elements-to-evidence gap analysis |
| Drafting runs | → | Skeleton document regeneration when facts change |
| Cross-model verification | → | Ethics/conflict sentinel checks on every output before human review |

The binding constraint is not capacity — it is **matter packets to feed**: attorney-approved scope,
documents, dates, jurisdiction, and instructions. One active matter consumes approximately 20-40
workunits/month in steady-state operations. A fleet of 14K+ idle workunits can sustain many matters
simultaneously once intake, privilege handling, and review gates are wired. The first matter
(Anthony's ADA employment case, augmenting attorney Micah Longo) proves the pipeline; scaling means
adding well-scoped matters, not inventing new legal authority.

## The org-chart (AI roles, human-supervised)

| Role | Institution equivalent | Does | Human check |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Managing Partner (the attorney)** | Named partner | strategy, judgment, advice, all filings + appearances | — (this is the human) |
| **Case Manager** | Managing clerk / case coordinator | maintains the single source of truth: posture, deadlines, open obligations, risk register | attorney approves the calendar and posture assessment |
| **Paralegal (Evidence)** | Litigation paralegal | builds + maintains the evidence index and chain-of-custody record; cross-references every document against the element map | attorney verifies completeness and admissibility |
| **Researcher** | Junior associate / research fellow | pulls controlling statute/precedent, maps elements to evidence, flags gaps, surfaces adverse authority (real authority only — never fabricated) | attorney validates every cite and legal conclusion |
| **Drafter** | Brief writer / documents clerk | produces document *skeletons* (timelines, fact statements, correspondence drafts, discovery responses) from the evidence index and element map | attorney rewrites, adopts, and owns every word |
| **Calendar/Deadlines Clerk** | Docketing clerk | tracks every court date, statutory deadline, contractual obligation, and lead-time alert; produces a living deadline calendar | attorney approves the calendar weekly |
| **Ethics/Conflict Sentinel** | Ethics partner / conflicts committee | enforces privilege, UPL boundary, and conflict guardrails on every output; certifies each deliverable before it reaches the attorney | attorney is final arbiter |

The point of the chart: each role is a **workflow the conductor can run continuously**, so the matter
is always organized, always current, always ready — the leverage a big firm buys with headcount.

The attorney remains the center of gravity. These roles do not make decisions; they prepare the ground
so the attorney's decisions are better informed and faster.

## Current build surface

This charter's first implementation surface is deliberately small and local. The organ is buildable
when each matter can be represented as a folder of reviewable artifacts:

```text
organs/legal/
  KERNEL.md                  # invariant model + guardrails
  CHARTER.md                 # this virtual-firm operating charter

    ethics-log.md            # sentinel checks and human approvals
  validate-legal.py          # executable guardrail/presence validator
```

The first live matter packet now exists at
[`matters/anthony-ada-employment-2026/`](matters/anthony-ada-employment-2026/). It is deliberately
source-backed and conservative: real matter identity and counsel boundary are indexed from existing
organ records; primary employer, medical, agency, court, and privileged attorney-client records remain
outside the repo until counsel/client approve an intake path. Until counsel supplies or approves real
matter facts, the packet surfaces gaps instead of inventing specifics.

## The firm-wide workflows it runs

Each workflow maps to the 5-primitive kernel (Member/Mandate/Standing/Standard/Governance) and
produces a specific artifact. Workflows run on a **cadence** — continuous for indexing, daily for
standing, weekly or on-event for drafting.

### 1. Intake → posture (Standing + Member)

- **Trigger:** new matter opened or facts change.
- **Process:** capture client/party identity (Member), the claim/matter scope (Mandate), current
  procedural stage, open obligations, risks, and leverage (Standing).
- **Runs:** on intake + on any material fact change.
- **Output:** a living case-posture brief — one page, always current. Sections: parties, matter,
  stage, deadlines, open items, risk register, leverage assessment.
- **Human gate:** attorney reviews and approves posture assessment.
- **Build path:** first as `matters/<matter-id>/intake.md` and `posture.md`; later as a structured
  intake form that writes the same fields.

### 2. Evidence → index (Member + Standard)

- **Trigger:** document ingested or fact asserted.
- **Process:** every document, message, record, and communication is indexed with: date, source,
  author, recipient, provenance, what element it supports, and chain-of-custody entry. Conflicting
  evidence flagged for attorney review.
- **Runs:** continuously as documents arrive; full reconciliation scan weekly.
- **Output:** evidence index — sortable, filterable, citable. Each entry is a row with: ID, date,
  source, type, element(s) supported, chain-of-custody, notes.
- **Human gate:** attorney verifies completeness, relevance, and admissibility.
- **Build path:** first as `evidence-index.csv` plus a document naming convention; later as OCR/import
  adapters that append rows but never overwrite provenance.

### 3. Law → elements map (Standard + Mandate)

- **Trigger:** matter opened, new authority identified, or new claim theory emerges.
- **Process:** controlling statute, regulation, and precedent are pulled (real authority only). The
  claim is decomposed into legal elements. Each element is linked to the evidence that supports it
  and flagged where proof is thin or absent. Adverse authority is surfaced, never buried.
- **Runs:** on intake + on any new authority or theory change.
- **Output:** elements-to-evidence matrix — elements as rows, evidence citations as columns, with
  confidence ratings and gap flags.
- **Human gate:** attorney validates every cited authority and the legal element decomposition.
- **Build path:** first as `elements-map.md` populated from attorney-provided authorities; later as a
  cite-fetch/check workflow that only records verifiable authority.

### 4. Deadlines → calendar (Standing + Governance)

- **Trigger:** matter opened, deadline set, date passes, or lead-time threshold hit.
- **Process:** every obligation (court deadline, statutory limitation, contractual date, discovery
  response, filing due date) is tracked with lead-time alerts at configurable thresholds (e.g., 30
  days, 14 days, 7 days, 24 hours). No deadline is owned by the system; all alerts are advisory.
- **Runs:** daily — calendar rebuilt every 24h with proximity alerts.
- **Output:** deadline calendar — all dates sorted by proximity, with alert status. Never misses
  a date because the calendar runs daily whether the attorney looks or not.
- **Human gate:** attorney approves the calendar weekly and confirms critical deadlines.
- **Build path:** first as `deadlines.md` maintained from attorney-supplied dates; later as calendar
  export/reminder integrations after explicit approval.

### 5. Draft → review (Governance + Mandate)

- **Trigger:** attorney requests a draft, or facts/elements change materially.
- **Process:** document skeletons (timelines, fact statements, correspondence drafts, discovery
  responses, demand letters, brief sections) are generated from the evidence index + elements map.
  Every skeleton is watermarked "DRAFT — NOT FILED, NOT FINAL" and routed through the Ethics
  Sentinel before human delivery.
- **Runs:** on demand or on material change to underlying data.
- **Output:** reviewable draft skeletons — never complete filings, never final. Always clearly
  marked as draft work product.
- **Human gate:** attorney rewrites, adopts, and owns every word. Nothing is filed or sent by
  the system.
- **Build path:** first as Markdown files under `drafts/`; later as template-assisted generation from
  the index and elements map. Every file remains review-only.

### 6. Ethics / conflict check (Governance — cross-cuts all)

- **Trigger:** every output before delivery to the attorney.
- **Process:** each deliverable is checked against: privilege boundaries (no privileged material in
  unprivileged channels), UPL guardrails (no legal advice, no practice of law), conflict screens
  (against all matters in the organ), and confidentiality requirements. The sentinel is the
  last automated step before any artifact reaches the attorney.
- **Runs:** continuously, as a gate on every output workflow.
- **Output:** ethics certification — a stamp on every deliverable: "Ethics/Conflict check passed:
  privilege intact, UPL boundary held, no conflicts identified."
- **Human gate:** attorney is the final arbiter of all ethics and privilege decisions.
- **Build path:** first as `ethics-log.md` entries attached to each artifact; later as an automated
  preflight that blocks artifacts missing source, draft status, or human-review fields.

```

Every workflow feeds the next. Evidence index supports the elements map. Elements map + evidence
index support drafting. Ethics sentinel gates everything. The attorney stands at the end of every
path — no artifact reaches an external destination without human judgment.

## Inputs / outputs

### Inputs (what the attorney or client supplies)

| Input | Format | Source | Maps to kernel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Matter facts | Structured intake form or narrative | Client / attorney | Member + Mandate |
| Documents, messages, records | PDF, text, email, image, spreadsheet | Client, attorney, discovery | Member + Standard |
| Controlling jurisdiction | Jurisdiction name + area of law | Attorney designates | Standard |
| Counsel-approved theory / exclusions | Written instruction, correction, or "do not analyze" list | Attorney | Mandate + Governance |
| Attorney instructions | Direction, feedback, correction | Attorney | Governance |
| Deadlines and obligations | Dates, rules, court orders | Court rules, attorney | Standing |

### Outputs (what the organ delivers to the attorney)

| Output | Format | Cadence | Maps to kernel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Case-posture brief | Markdown (one page) | Updated on fact change + weekly | Standing |
| Evidence index | Markdown or structured data (JSON/CSV) | Continuous as docs arrive | Member + Standard |
| Elements-to-evidence matrix | Markdown table or structured data | Updated on new authority/claim change | Standard + Mandate |
| Deadline calendar | Markdown list sorted by proximity | Updated daily | Standing + Governance |
| Draft skeletons | Markdown with DRAFT watermark | On demand or on material change | Mandate + Governance |
| Risk register | Markdown table | Updated with posture | Standing |
| Ethics certification | Inline stamp on each deliverable | Every output | Governance |

All outputs are **advisory-to-the-attorney**. None are self-acting, none are filed, none are
communicated externally without the attorney's review and execution.

## Exact mechanism — how one person gets the weight

The organ gives one person top-firm weight through four concrete mechanisms:

1. **Persistent memory of the matter:** posture, evidence, law map, dates, and ethics checks live as
   separate artifacts instead of in one person's head or inbox.
2. **Parallel role separation:** evidence, law, drafting, docketing, and ethics are handled by distinct
   workflows, so each output can check the others the way firm staff checks partner work.
3. **Cadence:** daily/weekly beats keep the matter current even when counsel is busy, producing the
   advantage large firms get from staff who keep working between attorney touchpoints.
4. **Attorney-controlled choke point:** everything stops at counsel. The system increases prepared
   surface area; counsel supplies legal judgment, communication, filing, negotiation, and signature.

That is the Cochran standard in buildable form: not "AI lawyer," but a disciplined back office that
keeps evidence, deadlines, drafts, and review gates in motion until the attorney has a top-tier
institutional surface to act from.

## How the institutional weight works (the leverage math)

A top-tier firm's leverage comes from **ratio**: one partner with 3 associates, 2 paralegals, a
docketing clerk, and an evidence room. That's a 1:7 ratio. The partner's hour is worth 7x because
the bench finds, organizes, drafts, and tracks while the partner strategizes and advocates.

This organ delivers that bench as **continuous processing**. The key multipliers:

| Factor | Solo firm | This organ (steady state) | Source of leverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Evidence indexing | On demand, attorney does it | Continuous, re-indexed on every document arrival | Idle fleet capacity does the scanning and cross-referencing |
| Deadline tracking | Manual calendar + human memory | Daily automated rebuild with proximity alerts | Runs every 24h regardless of attorney attention |
| Element mapping | Attorney builds and maintains | Rebuilt when facts or law change | Background processing beat |
| Drafting | From scratch each time | From current evidence index + element map | Structured data always ready |
| Ethics coverage | Attorney self-policing | Automated sentinel on every output | Cross-model verification run |
| Total effective bench | 1 person | 6 full-time-equivalent roles | Idle fleet capacity mapped to legal workflows |

The attorney still does what only the attorney can do: strategy, judgment, advocacy, filings,
client communication, and every outward-facing act. The organ does what headcount would do:
find, organize, track, draft, and verify.

## First proof: the micro instance

The micro instance — Anthony's ADA employment matter — is the first deployment, packaged as
[FRAMEWORK-FOR-MICAH.md](FRAMEWORK-FOR-MICAH.md) and the live matter packet at
[`matters/anthony-ada-employment-2026/`](matters/anthony-ada-employment-2026/): a deck and evidence
room attorney Micah Longo can inspect immediately. Source-backed facts are separated from counsel/client
intake gaps; the system refuses to populate employer, medical, agency, court, or legal-deadline
specifics without authorized records.

The SCRUM: run workflow 1 (intake → posture) and workflow 2 (evidence → index) against the real
matter facts once Micah provides them. Workflow 4 (deadlines → calendar) runs as soon as dates
are known. Workflows 3 and 5 build on the index output.

The first live artifact set is:

- `matter.yaml` — structured matter contract, gates, artifacts, and forbidden acts.
- `posture.md` — one-page matter posture, source-backed and awaiting Micah's correction.
- `evidence-index.csv` — every current source record logged with source and chain-of-custody notes.
- `chain-of-custody.md` — custody entries and the primary evidence intake protocol.
- `elements-map.md` — proof-bucket matrix for counsel verification, with no invented authority.
- `deadlines.md` — all known dates and unknowns, explicitly marked for counsel confirmation.
- `ethics-log.md` — UPL, privilege, authority, custody, and outbound-action sentinel checks.
- `FRAMEWORK-FOR-MICAH.md` — the presentation wrapper, not a substitute for counsel's direction.

## Future scaling (non-blocking, noted for later maturity bands)

When the organ reaches building stage (30%+):

- **Multi-matter support**: the same workflow stack runs against N matters simultaneously, each
  with its own evidence index, element map, deadline calendar, and sentinel scope.
- **Matter intake portal**: a structured intake form that non-attorney users can complete, producing
  a draft posture brief for attorney review.
- **Template library**: jurisdiction-specific skeleton libraries (demand letter, complaint, discovery
  requests, settlement agreement) that reduce drafting time further.
- **Authority database**: a curated, attorney-verified repository of controlling law by jurisdiction
  that accelerates the Law → elements map workflow.
- **PR / disclosure reviews**: the same indexing + sentinel workflow applied to public statements,
  press releases, or other communications that need legal review.

All future builds preserve the invariant: no legal advice, no practice of law, no self-acting
external communications, and the attorney of record owns every output.

## Constraint registry

| Constraint | Why | How it's enforced |
|---|---|---|
| No legal advice or UPL | Practicing law without a license is illegal and unethical | Ethics Sentinel blocks every output; KERNEL.md is prepended to every workflow prompt |
| No self-filing or self-sending | Only the attorney can file, serve, or communicate externally | No workflow output path leads to an external destination; all outputs stop at the attorney |
| No fabricated authority | Invented citations destroy credibility and violate ethics | Researcher workflow explicitly pulls real authority only; cross-verified before delivery |
| Privilege boundary | Attorney-client privilege must never be breached | Ethics Sentinel scans for privileged content crossing channels |
| Attorney owns every output | The attorney is responsible for everything bearing their name | Every deliverable is clearly marked as draft/skeleton/review-required |

All constraints are non-negotiable. They are the load-bearing walls of this organ.
