"""heal-dispatch.py — close the loop verify-dispatch.py opened. NO SILENT FAILURES.

recover.py heals failed + orphaned-jules. It does NOT know about the silent-failure
classes verify-dispatch.py surfaces, so those tasks sit stuck in 'dispatched' forever:
  - PR_MERGED        : PR merged but task still 'dispatched'  → status=done (work landed)
  - PR_CLOSED        : PR closed unmerged                     → status=open (re-dispatch)
  - DISPATCHED_NO_PR : local lane 'dispatched' but no PR URL  → status=open (re-dispatch)

Safe by the same rules as recover.py: only flips status (+ a heal log entry), never
deletes, never pushes/merges/dispatches. Reversible. Acquires the shared queue-lock so it
never races the daemon's tasks.yaml writes; RELOADS fresh under the lock and RE-CHECKS each
task's current state before changing it (so it can't clobber progress the daemon made
between the verify pass and now). Dry-run by default; --apply to write.

Usage:  python3 scripts/heal-dispatch.py [--apply]
