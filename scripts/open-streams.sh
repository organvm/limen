#!/usr/bin/env bash
# open-streams.sh — open every READY session stream, each in its own TTY. One command.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
#   `check-session-streams.py --ready` DERIVES the openable set, but it is a printer: its output is
#   formatted for human eyes, and its only registered consumer (gates.yaml) runs the checker bare as
#   a validator. So the operator's round trip was: exit the session, run --ready, read four blocks,
#   open four terminal tabs, retype four commands. That is precisely the hand-loop the registry
#   exists to abolish, displaced one level up — and worse, until this change the printed command
#   omitted --agent and so opened no agent at all.
#
# WHY tmux AND NOT `cmd &`
#   `limen workstream --agent ...` ENDS IN exec (start-worktree-session.sh:479): it replaces its own
#   process with the agent's kickstart. An interactive agent needs a controlling TTY, so backgrounding
#   it in one shell does not give you N sessions — it gives you N headless jobs with nowhere to type.
#   tmux is the cheapest thing that hands each stream a real TTY, survives the operator closing the
#   laptop, needs no AppleScript/GUI, and is already installed.
#
# CONCURRENCY IS BOUNDED ON PURPOSE
#   Interactive agent sessions are heavy and this estate runs on a 16GB machine with LOGGED jetsam
#   kills; CLAUDE.md caps concurrent heavy processes for exactly that reason. Opening every ready
#   stream at once is the shape that gets killed, and a killed session loses its context silently.
#   The bound is DERIVED from physical RAM (see the helper) rather than being a magic number, is
#   overridable with --max-parallel / $LIMEN_STREAMS_MAX_PARALLEL, and every deferred stream is
#   NAMED with its exact command — a silent cap would read as "all four opened" when it did not.
#
# IDEMPOTENT
#   Re-running opens only what is not already open, on ONE authority: the liveness probe. A stream
#   with a session attached reads `live` and never reaches this script; a dormant stream reaches it
#   and is REOPENED — respawned into its kept tmux window when one survives, a fresh window
#   otherwise. Window presence is NOT the test (a kept window is the closeout display, not a
#   running stream — treating it as one froze every exited lane on SKIP, first live proof
#   2026-07-29).
#
# WHICH LANE OPENS THEM IS THE OPERATOR'S CHOICE, NOT THE REGISTRY'S
#   The registry emits `--agent auto` and may never pin a provider — the capsule contract declares
#   `lane_selection: derive_from_live_capabilities`. `auto` resolves through the live census ordered
#   by $LIMEN_AGENT, so on a stock host census ORDER picks the lane (codex, not claude). `--lane`
#   puts that choice where it belongs: in the environment, for this run only. Vendor-neutrality
#   stays in declared data; the operator still gets to say who opens the work.
#
# THE DEFAULT FAMILY IS THE OPERATOR'S LIFE/WORK DOMAINS
#   Rows carry `family: domain` (derived from the workstream channel roster — the operator's
#   life/work domains: correspondence, financial, representation, …, the streams he actually
#   means; 2026-07-30 correction), `family: constellation` (the collaborator person-streams —
#   the consulting domain's interior), or `family: governance` (hand-authored estate work).
#   "Open my streams" must never answer with plumbing or with one domain's interior, so the
#   default opens domain only; the other families are counted, named as skipped, and reachable
#   via --family constellation / --family governance (or everything via --family all).
#
# THE ROUND TRIP (open → exit → reopen)
#   Exiting the agent (/exit, or however the lane ends) KEEPS the tmux window — it prints
#   `── stream X exited — window kept ──` and drops to a shell so the closeout stays readable.
#   `Ctrl-b d` detaches from tmux without stopping anything. An exited stream's worktree remains
#   and the registry classifies it `dormant`: the next run of this script REOPENS it (labelled
#   REOPEN), re-entering the same worktree and branch. `--status` shows the whole cycle at a
#   glance: live (pid) / dormant / ready / blocked / stale / settled.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/open-streams.sh                  # open + reopen the life/work domains, up to the bound
#   scripts/open-streams.sh --status         # one line per stream with its derived state
#   scripts/open-streams.sh --family all     # ...plus the constellation + governance rows
#   scripts/open-streams.sh --lane claude    # ...on a chosen lane (claude|codex|agy|opencode|…)
#   scripts/open-streams.sh --dry-run        # print exactly what would open, touch nothing
#   scripts/open-streams.sh --max-parallel 1 # open one, name the rest
#   scripts/open-streams.sh --all            # ignore the bound (you accept the jetsam risk)
