"""Paid-agent router — the conductor's missing thin piece.

Assigns each OPEN work-item to a capable AVAILABLE paid service, instead of
dumping the whole backlog on one lane (which is what starved the local fleet on
2026-06-16: 100 tasks all routed to Jules, codex/opencode/agy idle).

Cost model (the "tiering", one level up from model-tiering):
  - Local lanes (codex/opencode/agy/claude/gemini) use a local checkout. Among
    them the split is made by TWO live signals: per-agent daily BUDGET headroom
    (don't dump all on one lane) and refresh-window RUNWAY from the usage meter
    (don't feed a lane pacing toward its reserve) — so load steers to the FRESHEST
    window and no lane is burned to 0 while another sits idle.
  - Local lanes can clone a repo on demand through dispatch.py, so they are capable
    for any task with a repo. Jules remains the async cloud lane for large batches
    and as a remote fallback, not the only no-checkout escape hatch.
  - Copilot assigns an existing GitHub issue to copilot-swe-agent.
  - GitHub Actions triggers a configured workflow_dispatch workflow.
  - Warp/Oz are configurable paid-service lanes via LIMEN_WARP_DISPATCH_CMD and
    LIMEN_OZ_DISPATCH_CMD, or the generic agent-dispatch adapter.
  - Health: a service with no usable auth/CLI/config is skipped. The LIVE usage
    meter (logs/usage.json) additionally drops any lane that is token-exhausted,
    rate-limited, or at/below its pacing reserve (`_down_lanes`) — route and
    dispatch agree on which lanes can actually produce, and a lane rejoins the
    instant its rolling window refills.
  - Capacity: every run prints a census of the paid fleet, then distributes work
    across every reachable capable lane so no paid service sits idle while work
    exists.

Read-only by default: prints a routing plan. With --apply it only rewrites each
task's target_agent in tasks.yaml (reversible) — it never dispatches. Dispatch
stays a separate, explicitly-gated step (`limen dispatch --agent X --live`).

Usage:
  python3 route.py [--tasks tasks.yaml] [--apply] [--workdir ~/Workspace]
