"""ingest-backlog — release STAGED Studium expansion tasks into the live fleet queue, SAFELY.

The Studium's breadth (per-work music deepening, film companions, corpus fetches) is staged in
studium/expansion-backlog.yaml under a release-hold. This is the SANCTIONED funnel that merges the
CONTENT-class tasks into the daemon-contended tasks.yaml as a re-emitting C_FEED voice:

  * LOCKLESS + atomic — exactly like the sibling generate-backlog / generate-revenue-backlog voices.
    The daemon does NOT hold the queue lock across a beat, so taking queue_lock here would only STARVE
    this voice (it times out under live contention and skips every beat — the tasks never land). It
    re-reads fresh right before the write, then atomic-saves (temp file -> os.replace).
  * IDEMPOTENT + SELF-HEALING — only NEW task ids are appended, so it runs every beat as a no-op once
    seeded; if a long concurrent dispatch save ever clobbers the rows, the next beat simply re-adds
    them. (A one-shot lock-guarded apply was the bug; a re-emitting voice is the cure.)

It respects the backlog's OWN internal gates: only the content-authoring sections are released
(deepening — MINUS the in-flight odyssey — plus corpus_gaps and film.first_pass). The his-gate
sections (community / community_interaction / analysis / tier2_staged / Letterboxd posting) and any
row carrying a `gate:` field are NEVER released here.

Read-only by default (prints exactly what it WOULD add). With --apply it appends losslessly + atomically.
Never dispatches; the live daemon (autonomy mode "dispatch") routes the new tasks on its own beats.

PRECONDITION (executability): the fleet executes a task by cloning the repo's DEFAULT branch. These
content tasks need the studium/ scaffold (canon.yaml, the book-01 templates, scripts/studium-validate.py)
to be present on that branch. If the scaffold is not yet on origin/main, releasing these tasks would
seed dead-end work — get the scaffold onto the clone target FIRST (the studium go-live merge).

Usage:
  python3 scripts/ingest-backlog.py                                   # dry-run vs $LIMEN_ROOT/tasks.yaml
  python3 scripts/ingest-backlog.py --tasks ~/Workspace/limen/tasks.yaml --apply
