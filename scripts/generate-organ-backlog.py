"""generate-organ-backlog — feed idle capacity INSTITUTION-BUILDING work (the VLTIMA organs).

The diagnosis (2026-06-23): the fleet runs at ~25-33% of capacity; the binding constraint is the
SUPPLY of high-value work, not capacity. Meanwhile the user has eight-plus half-built INSTITUTIONS
(legal, financial, education, media, governance, consulting, artist, social, health) — the pillars the
rich have behind them and he wants rebuilt as AI-run organs ("the prosthesis for human weakness"; his
own term: VLTIMA MATERIA). The idle horsepower and the unfinished organs are the same problem from two
ends. This converts the institutional census (organ-ladder.json) into bounded, dispatchable build
tasks so every beat drives every organ toward its next maturity band.

Sibling of generate-revenue-backlog.py — SAME safety contract: identity DERIVED from organ-ladder.json
(never pinned); read-only by default (prints a plan); with --apply it appends `open` tasks via the
limen schema (validated, atomic, fresh re-read before write) so it can't clobber a concurrent dispatch
write; never dispatches; floor-gated + id-deduped + capped (bounded, no flood). Organ artifacts are
authored into the limen repo under organs/<pillar>/ (the proven Studium home) so dispatch never hits a
dead clone.
