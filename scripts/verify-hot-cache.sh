#
# The Meeseeks law (plan 2026-07-30): every summoned surface is born for one purpose, executes,
# returns its result to source, and self-erases — residue is a defect. This predicate is the law's
# court: it proves the LOCAL machine holds nothing that is not re-summonable from upstream, so
# losing the disk (or jacking into a fresh one via portvs) loses zero state.
#
# Rungs (independent; every red is listed, then exit 1):
#   R1 spine     — chezmoi source is the real cartridge clone (scripts/cartridge-connected.py)
#   R2 capture   — deployed config carries no un-captured local state (scripts/chezmoi-drift.py)
#   R3 creds     — every materialized credential still authenticates (creds-hydrate --verify)
#   R4 toolchain — the declared toolchain is summonable (mise.toml resolves via `mise current`)
#   R5 repos     — every clone under $LIMEN_WORKDIR is clean, pushed, and stash-free
#   R6 residue   — the residue R5 steps over is within its declared caps (scripts/residue-census.py)
#
# R5 and R6 divide the same territory deliberately. R5 asks whether state is UN-SUMMONABLE (dirty,
# unpushed, stashed) and excludes worktrees/quarantines because they carry their own reap organs.
# R6 asks whether those organs are KEEPING UP — 39 worktrees, 517 branches, 10 GiB of runtime and a
# 571 MiB ledger are all perfectly summonable and still residue. Neither rung reaps anything.
#
# Fail-open where an ORGAN is absent (mise not installed → named advisory skip); loud where STATE
# is un-summonable (dirty tree, unpushed commits, credential drift). Read-only — never mutates.
# Beat-wired as the hot-cache sensor (sensors.yaml, gate LIMEN_HOTCACHE_CHECK, daily cadence).
