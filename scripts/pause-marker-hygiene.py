"""Pause-marker hygiene predicate — an AUTONOMY_PAUSED marker that can never autoclear is a defect.

The recurring freeze (2026-07-14 → 2026-07-15 → 2026-07-16, three times): a
``logs/AUTONOMY_PAUSED`` marker whose release path the governor can never reach. current_mode()
returns ``"paused"`` for *any* marker unless _marker_owner_merged() clears it — and that clears
ONLY when a resolvable ``pr:``/``owner:`` coordinate names a MERGED PR. A marker carrying only an
``owner_surface:`` prose line (which never parses as ``owner:``), or an ``owner:`` label that
matches no branch, can therefore idle the whole beat forever. autonomy-governor's own docstring
(``_marker_owner_merged``) documents this as "the 2026-07-15 freeze recurrence". Nothing catches it.
This is that catch.

A marker is HEALTHY when it can either self-clear or tell someone how to clear it:
  • a release COORDINATE — a ``pr:`` number or a non-empty ``owner:`` branch that is still
    merge-reachable (best-effort resolved against GitHub when ``gh`` is available; fail-OPEN so
    offline/gh-down never false-fails). The governor autoclears ONLY on a MERGED PR, so a coordinate
    that resolves to a CLOSED-but-unmerged PR is itself a defect — it can never self-clear (the
    superseded-coordinate case: a preservation/draft PR whose remedy was extracted into other PRs and
    which then closes unmerged, leaving the marker pinned to a dead coordinate), OR
  • a ``next_command:`` recovery runbook (machine-executable per the 2026-07-15 discipline).

Exit 0 ⟺ no marker, or the marker is healthy.
Exit 1 ⟺ a marker exists that can neither self-clear nor be cleared by runbook — no coordinate/runbook,
         a coordinate that matches NO PR, or a coordinate that names only a CLOSED-unmerged PR.

Wired advisory into the beat (institutio/governance/sensors.yaml → ``pause-marker-hygiene``): an
advisory sensor never breaks the beat, it just surfaces the defect with a ``↑`` every cycle until a
release coordinate or runbook is added. Standalone it is a plain predicate for CI / omega / a
session. Read-only; the marker is never written here.
