"""self-heal.py — the SELF-HEAL rung of the self-* ladder.

merge-drain.py classifies PRs that are genuinely READY and correctly REFUSES the ones that
are CI-RED or CONFLICTING. Its default and scheduled modes are preview-only; a separate signed
exact-target authorization is required for a merge effect. But nothing fixes refused PRs, so the open-PR floor never
falls — the stuck pile just sits. This organ closes that gap: every heal beat it assesses the
open PRs (exactly as merge-drain does), and for each CI-RED or CONFLICT PR it EMITS a targeted
heal task into the queue so the existing router+dispatcher picks it up and an agent fixes the
PR in a worktree → the PR becomes an accepted candidate → the signed merge owner can act.

This is alchemical progress toward ideal form (the fleet repairing its OWN work), NOT reduction.

Safety / shape (matches the sibling organs exactly):
  • SCAN side is identical to merge-drain.py (same OWNERS, same `gh search prs --author @me`,
    the same assess() classifier: READY / CI-RED / CI-PENDING / CONFLICT). Read-only `gh`.
  • EMIT side uses the ONE safe shared-append path every tasks.yaml writer uses: acquire the
    daemon's queue-lock (logs/.queue.lock.d, the heal-dispatch.py convention), RELOAD fresh
    under the lock, append validated limen Task objects, save via the atomic writer
    (limen.io.save_limen_file → temp file + fsync + os.replace). Never a naive open()/dump,
    so it can NEVER race the daemon or torn-read tasks.yaml.
  • IDEMPOTENT: each heal task has a STABLE id derived from kind+owner+repo+num
    (HEAL-cifix-… / HEAL-rebase-…). If that id already exists in tasks.yaml (any status), no
    duplicate is emitted — re-running is a no-op until the PR's state changes.
  • FULL COVERAGE, BOUNDED COST: one cheap enumeration of EVERY open PR (shared _pr_scan), then a
    rotating --scan window is assessed per beat (default 30) so the whole backlog is covered over
    successive beats — not just the head-of-list 30 forever. --limit caps heal tasks emitted this
    run (default 10, lifted up to 3x when vendor capacity is idle). Never dispatches/merges/pushes.

  --scan N      assess WINDOW per run — PRs classified this beat, rotating (default 30)
  --scan-max N  cap on the cheap full-fleet enumeration the window draws from (default 500)
  --limit N     max heal tasks to EMIT this run, headroom-scaled (default 10)
  --dry-run     assess + report what WOULD be emitted; make ZERO writes (cursor + lock untouched)
