# The predicate must NEVER return CLEARED (exit 0) on a state GitHub won't actually merge, or on
# an indeterminate state. This test stubs `gh` with canned PR JSON and asserts the exit code for
# every mergeStateStatus, the closed-PR guard, the website-sensitive gate, and the failing/pending
# paths. Deterministic + idempotent: exit 0 ⟺ all cases pass.
#
# Guards two real bugs found 2026-06-24:
#   - mss=BLOCKED (required check not run on a pre-existing PR) was wrongly CLEARED.
#   - mss=UNKNOWN (GitHub still computing mergeability) was wrongly CLEARED.
