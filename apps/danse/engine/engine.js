/** One step of the piece. The live page and the film both come through here.
 *
 * This module exists so there is exactly one answer to "what is on screen at
 * (seed, t)". A browser tab at 60fps, an offline renderer walking 23,400 frames
 * out of order across two processes, and a still exported for Instagram all call
 * `step` and all get the same frame — because `step` is a pure function and the
 * clock underneath it has no memory.
 *
 * The only thing the live page does differently is `quantise`, and that is a
 * parameter rather than a fork: casting cells walks 162 index entries per cell,
 * which at 60fps is work nobody can see. Geometry and camera still move every
 * frame; only the CHOICE is held. The film passes 0 and pays for exactness.
