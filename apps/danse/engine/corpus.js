/** That afternoon, indexed — and delivered progressively.
 *
 * The engine has to choose a photograph before it has downloaded one. So the
 * manifest carries geometry rather than pixels: each frame's matte coverage, the
 * bounding box and centroid of the figure, and whichever joints Vision could find.
 * `candidates()` answers "who is standing in this part of the room?" out of that
 * index alone, and the picture is fetched only once the choice is made.
 *
 * Two tiers exist because 162 photographs at screen resolution is 22 MB and a
 * gallery machine should not stare at a blank wall for 22 MB. `browse` (512px) is
 * the whole corpus, small enough to ship eagerly; `screen` (1024px) arrives per
 * frame, on demand, and swaps in mid-render. `plate()` therefore never blocks and
 * never returns nothing once the eager tier has landed — it returns the best
 * thing that exists right now and quietly asks for better.
