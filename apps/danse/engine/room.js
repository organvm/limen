/** The room, and where a photograph hangs in it.
 *
 * On 20 June 2017 a camera stood in one place for 161 exposures. That fixed
 * viewpoint is not incidental history — it is the coordinate system every part of
 * this engine agrees on. Here it becomes an explicit object: a *projector*, sitting
 * exactly where the camera stood, casting that afternoon through the scene.
 *
 * The consequence is the whole architecture. A fragment does not decide what it
 * shows by carrying its own crop; it shows whatever the projector casts onto the
 * place it happens to occupy. Two planes at unrelated angles and depths therefore
 * put the floor line and the poster rail on the *same screen-space lines*, because
 * both fetched their pixels through one matrix. Continuity is a property of how
 * pixels are addressed, not a rule the generator has to remember to obey.
 *
 * Two independent axes open the still into a room:
 *
 *   geometry   planes at home and coplanar  →  planes at angles and depths
 *   projK      the plane is a WINDOW (0)    →  the plane is a CARRIED PICTURE (1)
 *
 * At `projK = 0` a plane shows whatever is behind it and its content changes as it
 * moves. At `projK = 1` it holds the crop it was assigned and carries it wherever it
 * goes. At the home position the two are *numerically identical* — which is exactly
 * why the 2017 composite is ambiguous between collage and room, and is asserted as
 * a self-test in `probe.html`.
