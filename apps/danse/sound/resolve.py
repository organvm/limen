"""Find the recordings made in that room — and say honestly what was found.

The score is generative from the same seed as the picture, which makes it
rights-clean by construction. What makes it *true* is the material: not a
synthesiser pretending to be a room, but sound actually recorded in the apartment
the 162 photographs were made in. That is the difference between a score and a
screensaver, and it is the one part of the sound the machine cannot manufacture.

So this catalogues rather than guesses. It writes `sources.json` — every
candidate, where it came from, how long it is, and how confident the provenance
is — and it never moves or converts an original. Re-run it with `--root` pointing
somewhere new and it folds the new find into the same catalogue.

Four channels, in descending order of how likely they are to hold that room:

  photos    Photos.app, via AppleScript. THE SANCTIONED PATH — the library is
            TCC-blocked at the shell, and this is the same channel the 161 stills
            came out of. A video shot that afternoon carries the room's actual
            air, which is the best material that could possibly exist for this.
  spotlight indexed audio in a date window, wherever it lives
  roots     an explicit directory walk, for drives Spotlight has not indexed
  daw       Logic / GarageBand projects, whose Media folders hold raw takes
