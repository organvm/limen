"""The room, cut into grains — the second corpus.

The picture selects fragments of a body out of 162 photographs, indexed by
geometry: where the figure stood, which joints Vision could find. The sound does
the same thing one axis over. The two confirmed recordings from that apartment
are cut into grains and indexed by what a grain SOUNDS like — spectral centroid,
brightness, decay — so `score.py` can ask "what is dark and slow?" the way
`grammar.js` asks "who is standing in this part of the room?", and answer it out
of the index without touching a sample.

No synthesis anywhere in the chain. Every sample that reaches the film was
recorded in that apartment in 2017.

Three kinds, because the score needs three different things:

    bed        long, quiet, low-flux stretches. The room's air, continuous
               underneath everything. Cut by sliding a window, NOT by onsets —
               the whole point of a bed is the part where nothing happens, and
               an onset detector is blind to it by construction.
    sustained  mid-length tonal material. One per active plane; depth sets pitch
               and reverb send, so the chord literally IS the spatial arrangement.
    transient  short and sharp. Limb events, decimated hard in the score — most
               of these are thrown away, and that is the decision that makes the
               rhythm countable by a dancer instead of by a profiler.

Requires ffmpeg (decode) plus numpy and scipy. Deliberately NOT librosa: the
analysis here is four textbook descriptors over one STFT, and this repo's CI
should not grow a 60 MB dependency to compute a weighted mean.
