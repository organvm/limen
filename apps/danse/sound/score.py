"""f(seed, program) -> stereo WAV. The same seed as the picture.

The score is not written to the film; it is DERIVED from it. `control.mjs` runs
the real engine over the real program and reports what the picture is doing —
how deep each plane hangs, where it sits across the frame, which cells swapped
photograph — and this turns that into sound using only grains cut from the two
recordings confirmed to be from that apartment.

    bed        the room's air, continuous, crossfaded end to end. It is under
               everything because the room was under everything.
    voices     eight planes sampled through the depth order. Depth sets pitch
               and darkness, lateral position sets pan, so the chord IS the
               spatial arrangement — when the camera moves and the depth order
               changes, the chord voices itself differently.
    events     a cell swapping photograph fires a transient, DECIMATED to about
               one in eight. Throwing most of them away is the single decision
               that makes the rhythm countable by a dancer rather than by a
               profiler: at 30 re-casts a second, keeping them all is a wash.
    reseed     each epoch turn takes a bed grain down two octaves and swells it,
               then cuts to silence. Shortening across the accelerating reseeds.

Two things this deliberately does NOT do:

  * No synthesis. There is no oscillator anywhere. The sub-bass under a reseed is
    the room itself at quarter speed. If it is in the film, it was in the air of
    that apartment in 2017.
  * No artificial reverb. The material was recorded IN the room, so it already
    carries the room; convolving it with a synthetic hall would only smear what
    is already true. Distance is rendered the way distance actually reaches an
    ear — quieter, darker (air absorbs treble), lower, and narrower — which is
    filtering of the room's own sound rather than an invention of a second space.
